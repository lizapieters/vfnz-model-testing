    documentation="The Resource Configuration Management application is similar to the service design/ assign functions outlined elsewhere in this publication, but supports aggregate customer facing services. To explain this area in general, it is necessary to see a clear difference between services and networks /resources. Services can be viewed as being comprised of a number of building blocks - e.g. bandwidth, security, maintenance packages, SLAs, QoS, specific features e.g. voicemail.. Service Configuration management might be either the set up of network / resource components for a customer, or a class of customers of a generic service build. Service configuration can be derived from order details in addition to inherent business rules from service specifications and the service view in the Service Inventory Management application.">
