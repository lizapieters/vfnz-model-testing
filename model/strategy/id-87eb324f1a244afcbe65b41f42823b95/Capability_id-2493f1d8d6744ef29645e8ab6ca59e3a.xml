    documentation="The Usage Event Processing functions include collection, filtering, formatting, aggregation, enrichment, correlation, consolidation, storage, and delivery of usage event records. These functions are required to support both file and event based (batch and real-time) processing. The Usage Management function supports various types of charging for sessions and events, for example, application instance, Max/Min usage based on flexible time intervals or active users of the application in both batch and real-time. Usage event records are of various types and formats and are generated from event generating functions like networks, applications, infrastructures, �Management and Control� etc. Not all events in the scope of Usage events are always charged but might be required for correlation and enrichment of other usage events records. The network elements that may produce usage event records include, but are not limited to, components of the wireline, wireless, and IP networks. &#xA;The components include, but are not limited to, application servers, service delivery platforms, messaging servers, switches, routers, and other network elements, Orchestrator.">
