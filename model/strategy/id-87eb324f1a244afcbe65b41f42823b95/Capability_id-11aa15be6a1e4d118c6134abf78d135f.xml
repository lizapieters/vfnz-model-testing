    documentation="Customer Context Map Building (&quot;Interpret&quot;)provides the functionality to accumulate customer context in the systemic memory based on �observations� made on the customer through processing the data collected from customer experience monitoring and historical analysis. The context could include items such as customer transactions, interactions which are both implicit &amp; explicit. For example. when a customer pays his/her bill the context map is updated in real time to reflect the payment pattern and keep it up-to-date. Context map can be used by decision engines to drive appropriate treatment for customers based on recent behavior. For example a �late payer� or �chronic caller� may be treated differently from a normal payer or an occasional caller.">
