This includes orders placed in conjunction with a customer order as well as orders placed as part of service provider expansions of product, service, or network. Expansions can include purchases of inventory for future use by the service provider (e.g. � the service provider asks for a batch of SIM cards to replenish their SIM card inventory).A Supplier/Partner Order can also include a simple transaction with a partner concerning an application purchased via a product catalog, and the app is delivered (maybe just a download to the customer�s phone).">
