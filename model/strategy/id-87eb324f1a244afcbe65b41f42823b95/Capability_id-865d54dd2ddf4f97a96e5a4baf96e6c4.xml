    documentation="The Charge Calculation application assigns a value (monetary or other) to an event in the context of a product and payer. Charge calculation may be as simple as direct application of a price to an event or may be complicated, involving a combination of price and other factors (measurements). The values that result from a charge calculation are not limited to monetary values � they may represent many types of units (minutes, points, tokens, etc.).&#xA;The application accepts events that are:  &#xA;� Usage events / records or &#xA;� Events derived   from Customer and Order/Product information that indicate the need for recurring and onetime charges. &#xA;&#xA;The value that results from Charge Calculation may be used in many subsequent processes, including:&#xA;� affecting a balance (Balance Management) &#xA;� the preparation of an invoice (Bill Calculation)&#xA;�  pay-it-now processing options.&#xA;&#xA;The values that result from the calculation may be expressed as recurring charges/credits, one-time charges/credits, or usage charges/credits. &#xA;Taxes may be calculated for the individual customer specific charges using the Tax application, otherwise taxes are calculated by the Tax application during the bill calculation process.">
