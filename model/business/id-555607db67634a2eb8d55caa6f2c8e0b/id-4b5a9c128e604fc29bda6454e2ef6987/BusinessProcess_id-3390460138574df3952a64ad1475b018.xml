      value="The objective of the Track &amp; Manage Resource Trouble is to ensure testing, repair and restoration activities are assigned, coordinated and tracked efficiently, and that escalation is invoked as required for any open resource trouble reports in jeopardy. Responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to: â€¢Initiating first-in testing using automated remote testing capabilities; â€¢Adding additional information to an open resource trouble report based on the first-in testing; â€¢Scheduling, assigning and coordinating repair and restoration activities; â€¢Initiate any final testing to confirm clearance of the service problem; â€¢Undertake necessary tracking of the execution progress; â€¢Modifying information in an existing resource trouble report based on assignments; â€¢Modifying the resource trouble report status; â€¢Canceling a resource trouble report when the specific trouble was related to a false alarm event â€¢Monitoring the jeopardy status of open resource trouble reports, and escalating resource trouble reports as necessary. These processes will co-ordinate all the actions necessary in order to guarantee that all tasks are finished at the appropriate time and in the appropriate sequence. The Track &amp; Manage Resource Trouble processes are responsible for engaging external suppliers in correction and recovery activities when higher level expertise and/or higher level support is required to resolve the resource trouble. This engagement can be linked to the priority of the resource trouble report, and could occur automatically for highest priority resource trouble reports. The Track &amp; Manage Resource Trouble processes will also inform the Close Resource Trouble processes by modifying the resource trouble report status to cleared when the resource trouble has been resolved."/>
