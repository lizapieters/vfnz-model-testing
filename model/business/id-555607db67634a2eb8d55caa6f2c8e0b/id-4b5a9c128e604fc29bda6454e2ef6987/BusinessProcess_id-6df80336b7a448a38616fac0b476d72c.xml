      value="Apply Party Rate Level Discounts applies one or more discounts to a product price at an individual product level. A discount may be expressed as a monetary amount or percentage, and modifies a price for a product. When a discount is expressed as a percentage, the process determines the discount calculated in relation to the price for the product. The discount may be displayed as a separate entry on the bill or may be combined with the rate for the product to only show as one entry. Discounts may be a one-time event or may have some duration (days, months, life of product, etc.). Discounts may apply to a specific party or be generally available based on selection of products (for example - bundles). Discounting structures may involve tiers, tapers, time scheme or thresholds."/>
