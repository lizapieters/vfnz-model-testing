      value="Continual Service Improvement (CSI) is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at: http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx , Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for CSI (or equivalent) may apply in such cases. Continual Service Improvement represents pro-active mechanisms to help an organization to improve and realize benefits in terms of ROI (return on investment) and VOI (value on investment) along with intangible benefits of customer and staff satisfaction increasing. Note that while there may be a central focus for CSI within an organization, typically the activities to improve should form part of everyoneâ€™s roles. Everyone within the organization needs to be empowered to suggest improvement ideas and those who actually run the processes or areas of business affected by an Improvement activity should be expected to implement the solutions. â€¢Terminologyâ€¢ The use of â€œServiceâ€� in ITIL is more general than the usage within the Business Process Framework. ITIL Service can be mapped to Service or Product within the Business Process Framework, depending on the context and focus of the delivered capability. Typically, ITIL services delivered internally in an enterprise (say, between departments) will map to Service, while those delivered externally (to the enterpriseâ€™s customers) will map to Product. â€¢Linkage with eTOM process areasâ€¢ Process Identifier: 1.3.3 Process Element: Enterprise Effectiveness Management Process Impact: The Enterprise Effectiveness Management process grouping focuses on defining and providing the tools, methodologies and training to ensure that the enterprise processes and activities are managed and run efficiently and effectively, and can manage this in line with the ITIL context of Continual Service Improvement (CSI), where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned.
