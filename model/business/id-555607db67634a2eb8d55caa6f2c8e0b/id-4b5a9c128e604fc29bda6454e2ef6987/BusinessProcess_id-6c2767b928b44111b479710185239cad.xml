      value="The objective of the Report Resource Trouble processes is to monitor the status of resource trouble reports, provide notifications of any changes and provide management reports. These processes are responsible for continuously monitoring the status of resource trouble reports and managing notifications to processes and other parties registered to receive notifications of any status changes, for example, Resource Performance Management and Service Quality Management. Notification lists are managed and maintained by the Support Resource Trouble Management processes. These processes record, analyze and assess the resource trouble report status changes to provide management reports and any specialized summaries of the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall Resource Trouble Management process. These specialized summaries could be specific reports required by specific audiences. These processes will make the necessary reports about the resource trouble that occurred, the root cause and the activities carried out for restoration."/>
