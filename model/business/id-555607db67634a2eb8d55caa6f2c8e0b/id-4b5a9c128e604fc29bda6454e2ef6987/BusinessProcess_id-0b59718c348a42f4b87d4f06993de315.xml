      value="Develop Catalog Specification develops the specification (definition) for a catalog, relationships among catalogs, and attributes associated with a catalog. Specifications define attributes that are shared among catalogs described by the specification. Additional attributes, called characteristics, can also be defined using a generalized set of processes to create the attributes. This process focuses on associating them with a catalog specification. Relationships among catalogs include those that specify one catalog replaces another and those that define a group of catalogs, for example a content catalog that contains other catalogs that contain a specific category, such as drama movie category and a comedy drama category. Note: To minimize the number of sub-processes that update and remove various aspects of a catalog specification, such as relationships with other catalogs, it is assumed that the &quot;develop&quot; processes and their sub-processes also perform updates and removals."/>
