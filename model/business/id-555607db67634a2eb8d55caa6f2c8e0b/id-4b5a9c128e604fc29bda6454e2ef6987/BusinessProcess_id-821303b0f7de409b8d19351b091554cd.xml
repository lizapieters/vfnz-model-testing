      value="IT Service Continuity Management is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at: http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for IT Service Continuity Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases. IT Service Continuity Management operates in support of overall Business Continuity Management within the enterprise to ensure that the IT systems and support are available within the business, and to recover and restore IT service as required and agreed when service interruptions arise. The IT Service Continuity Manager will carry out a Business Impact Analysis (BIA) for all existing and new services and will then ensure that the results are included within the IT Service Continuity Plan which will be aligned to the Business Continuity Plan. This process is also responsible for carrying out risk assessments to ensure that these risks can be mitigated to prevent a disaster situation if it is justifiable to do so. â€¢Terminologyâ€¢ The use of â€œServiceâ€� in ITIL is more general than the usage within the Business Process Framework. ITIL Service can be mapped to Service or Product within the Business Process Framework, depending on the context and focus of the delivered capability. Typically, ITIL services delivered internally in an enterprise (say, between departments) will map to Service, while those delivered externally (to the enterpriseâ€™s customers) will map to Product. ITIL IT Services represent a subset of the services recognized within ITIL, which also identifies Business Services that these IT Services support and contribute to. â€¢Linkage with eTOM process areasâ€¢ Process Identifier: 1.3.2 Process Element: Enterprise Risk Management Process Impact: Where ITIL IT Service Continuity Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Enterprise Risk Management processes operate in line with this, so that business continuity management, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach. Process Identifier: 1.3.2.1 Process Element: Business Continuity Management Process Impact: Where ITIL IT Service Continuity Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Business Continuity Management processes operate in line with this, so that business continuity planning, infrastructure recovery planning, and serious incident management planning, etc., are then aligned with the ITIL approach."/>
