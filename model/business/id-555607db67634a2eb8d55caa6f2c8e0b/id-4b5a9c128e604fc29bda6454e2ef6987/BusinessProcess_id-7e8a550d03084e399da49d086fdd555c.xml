The processes determine the extent to which resource capabilities need to be sourced externally or delivered from internal capabilities, they scan external availability, and make recommendations about the specific external partners or suppliers who should be used to provide the resource capabilities. Note that the processes used to actually source any external suppliers occur with the Party Offering Development &amp; Retirement processes."/>
