      value="Release &amp; Deployment Management is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at: http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Release &amp; Deployment Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases. Release and Deployment Management includes all of the processes required to package, build, test and deploy a new or changed service into the live environment. This means that service delivery is managed across any service provider interfaces. â€¢Terminologyâ€¢ Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each take of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used. Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses. From the eTOM perspective, ITIL Release â€“ eTOM Product Release, Service Release, Resource Release ITIL Service â€“ eTOM CFS and RFS distinction â€¢Linkage with eTOM process areasâ€¢ ITIL Release &amp; Deployment Management relates to several eTOM process areas. The eTOM processes affected include: Within Operations: Process Identifier: 1.1.1.1 Process Element: Customer-Ops Support &amp; Readiness Process Impact: Where ITIL Release and Deployment Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer-Ops Support &amp; Readiness processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are: Support Order handling: Test order handling Process Identifier: 1.1.2.1 Process Element: Service-Ops Support &amp; Readiness Process Impact: Where ITIL Release and Deployment Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service-Ops Support &amp; Readiness processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are: Enable Service Configuration &amp; Activation: Test Service Configuration Process Identifier: 1.1.3.1 Process Element: Resource-Ops Support &amp; Readiness Process Impact: Where ITIL Release and Deployment Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource-Ops Support &amp; Readiness processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are: Enable Resource Provisioning: Test Resource Provisioning Within Strategy, Infrastructure &amp; Product Process Identifier: 1.2.1.3 Process Element: Product &amp; Offer Capability Delivery Process Impact: Where ITIL Release and Deployment Management as a guiding mechanism, then the Product &amp; Offer Capability Delivery processes operate in line with this. Affected processes are: Manage handover to Product Operations: manage product transition into operations Process Identifier: 1.2.2.2 Process Element: Service Capability Delivery Process Impact: Where ITIL Release and Deployment Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service Capability Delivery processes operate in line with this.
