      value="The objective of the Create Resource Trouble Report process is to create a new resource trouble report. A new resource trouble report may be created as a result of resource alarm event notification analysis, and subsequent creation of new resource alarm event records, undertaken by the Survey &amp; Analyze Resource Trouble processes, or at the request of analysis undertaken by other processes in the Service-Ops or Resource-Ops (in particular a Service Trouble Report can generate one or more Resource Trouble Reports) or Engaged Party-Ops and Resource-Ops layers which detect that some form of failure has occurred for which resource restoration activity is required to restore normal operation. If the resource trouble report is created as a result of a notification or request from processes other than the Survey &amp; Analyze Resource Trouble processes, the Create Resource Trouble Report processes are responsible for converting the received information into a form suitable for the Resource Trouble Management processes, and for requesting additional information if required. These processes will make estimates of the time to restore resource which will be included in the new resource trouble report so that other processes can gain access to this information."/>
