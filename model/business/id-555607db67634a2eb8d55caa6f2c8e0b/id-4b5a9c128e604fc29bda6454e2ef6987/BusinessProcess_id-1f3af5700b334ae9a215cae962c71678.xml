      value="The objective of the Report Customer QoS Performance processes is to monitor the status of customer QoS performance degradation reports, provide notifications of any changes and provide management reports. These processes are responsible for continuously monitoring the status of customer QoS performance degradation reports and managing notifications to other processes and to other parties, including customers, registered to receive notifications of any status changes. Notification lists are managed and maintained by the Support Customer QoS/SLA Management processes. These processes record, analyze and assess the customer QoS performance degradation report status changes to provide management reports and any specialized summaries of the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall Customer QoS/SLA Management process. These specialized summaries could be specific reports required by specific audiences and/or customers. These processes also report any identified constraints that can affect customer related quality standards to other processes. These constraints may include specific resource failures, capacity shortages due to unexpected demand peaks, etc."/>
