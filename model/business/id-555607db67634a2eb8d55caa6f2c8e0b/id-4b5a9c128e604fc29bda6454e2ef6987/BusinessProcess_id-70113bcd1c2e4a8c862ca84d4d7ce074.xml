      value="The objective of the Create Service Performance Degradation Report process is to create a new service performance degradation report, modify existing service performance degradation reports, and request cancellation of existing service performance degradation reports. A new service performance degradation report may be created as a result of specific service performance notifications undertaken by the Monitor Service Performance processes, or at the request of analysis undertaken by other Customer-Ops, Service-Ops or Resource-Ops processes which detect that some form of deterioration or failure has occurred requires an assessment of the specific service performance. If the service performance degradation report is created as a result of a notification or request from processes other than Monitor Service Performance processes, the Create Service Performance Degradation Report processes are responsible for converting the received information into a form suitable for the Service Performance Management processes, and for requesting additional information if required."/>
