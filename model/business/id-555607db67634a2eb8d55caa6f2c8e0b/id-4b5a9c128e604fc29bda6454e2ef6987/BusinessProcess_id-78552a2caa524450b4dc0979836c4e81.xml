      value="The purpose of this process is to develop a sales proposal to respond to the customerâ€™s requirements. This process commences following approval by the Qualify Customer process. The development of a sales proposal may require the selection of a standard product offering, may require the development of a non-standard offering, or may require the creation of a project team to construct an offering in response to a customerâ€™s Request For Proposal. In all cases, the processes are responsible for ascertaining the customerâ€™s requirements, determining the ability of the enterprise to support the customer requirements, and developing a proposal (or proposals) for the customer which meets the stated requirements. These processes assess the extent of enterprise support required to develop the sales proposal, marshal the necessary support across the enterprise and administer the sales proposal development activity to ensure that any timing constraints associated with eth customer requirements are achieved. Note that development of a non-standard sales proposal or the response to a customerâ€™s RFP may require the development of unique solution designs. The development of unique solutions, within the context of current deployed capabilities, uses the Design Solutions process within Service Management &amp; Operations to undertake the necessary feasibility studies. Where current capabilities are not able to support customerâ€™s requirements, the Product &amp; Offer Capability Delivery processes are invoked to undertake any necessary assessment and business case development.
