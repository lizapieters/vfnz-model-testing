      value="The Establish Resource Strategy &amp; Architecture processes proactively establish the resource strategies based on market trends, internal resource trends, future products needs, available and emerging resource capabilities, and addressing shortcomings in existing resource performance and operational support. These processes accept the changing resource requirements and develop appropriate resource strategies and strategic resource architectures based on the changing needs of the enterprise, and increasing expectations of the market. They establish realistic resource development and delivery goals for the enterprise and services to be delivered to the market. They establish implementation policies which act as a set of guidelines to be followed in the Resource Capability Delivery processes. They highlight shortcomings in existing resource performance and operational support arrangements and processes, including issues associated with resourcing and skill sets. Major inputs to these processes are derived from the Gather &amp; Analyze Resource Information and the Manage Resource Research processes. The processes may make use of AI based techniques to increase accuracy, agility and shorten TTM."/>
