It develops the program, prototypes it, tests it, rollouts/launches it, amends and evaluates it, and terminates it when it is no longer viable for an enterprise. Note that Royalty Program Development &amp; Retirement is sometimes viewed as comparable to Product Offering Development &amp; Retirement. While the rollout/launch, evaluate, amend, and terminate processes are similar the process other processes are different. For example, the Develop Loyalty Program process is quite different, as it includes sub-processes that focus on structuring the program, defining the program's currency, and capturing program requirements. Where noted, and to avoid duplication, existing Product Offering Development &amp; Retirement processes will be reused."/>
