      value="Asset Assurance process establishes the framework and operational systems necessary to ensure that all physical and logical resources in the enterprise are properly leveraged, specifically in terms of performance, lifecycle, quality, regulation and investments. Asset Assurance provides a framework to establish processes and data flows to enable DSPs to manage network assets across all dimensions of the asset life cycle to reduce stranded and underutilized assets. Asset Assurance operational capability establishes the processes for continual monitoring and controls at each phase of the asset lifecycle to provide the stakeholders with a holistic, networkwide view of all network assets from procurement through disposition, including all asset states (spare parts, on-air, project reserved, etc.). Asset Assurance provides the enterprise insights and processes to optimize the network performance and capacity including the establishment of tools and data collection capabilities to capture details of operational activity supporting the discovery, recapture, and redeployment of stranded or underutilized assets. These processes work in conjunction with operational and other process elements to guide DSPs in supporting the specific needs of Asset Assurance. Where appropriate, Asset Assurance processes supplement the capabilities of these other process elements, to control and analyze the enterprise behavior relevant to Asset Assurance needs. The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to: -Establishing an asset assurance policy framework, including the identification of controls and measures -Establishing and managing an operational process capability able to detect and resolve asset inefficiencies, stranded assets, over/under supply, or incorrect inventory information. -Establishing and managing a capacity to regularly review the asset assurance policy framework to ensure it meets the enterpriseâ€™s changing objectives."/>
