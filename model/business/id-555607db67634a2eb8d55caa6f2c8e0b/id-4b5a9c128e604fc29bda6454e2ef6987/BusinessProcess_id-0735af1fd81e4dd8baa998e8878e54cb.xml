      value="Manage Sales Prospect matches a sales prospect with the most appropriate products and ensure that a prospect is handled appropriately. A prospect represents a â€œpipelineâ€� of potential sales, each of which is expressed in terms of the probability of successful sales closure and an estimate of the total attainable revenue. The needs of a sales prospect are analyzed. Based on these needs, potential solutions are identified from an enterpriseâ€™s product catalog. The lifecycle of a prospect is tracked, and the outcome (win or loss) for a prospect is reported. A prospect is also assigned to the appropriate sales channel."/>
