      value="The purpose of the Assess Customer QoS/SLA Performance processes is to manage the overall assessment of the customer QoS/SLA performance. These processes are responsible for ensuring that the QoS received by the customer meets the contractual obligations agreed with the customer. They check that the QoS data that they receive from other processes and entities meets the required QoS thresholds and they alert other processes and entities if this is not the case. These processes are responsible for collecting service and resource performance information analyzed and reported by the Report Service Quality Performance and Report Resource Performance processes, and converting it into a form suitable for determining whether the contractual obligations with the customer are being met. The actual reporting of the results of the assessments is managed in the Report Customer QoS Performance processes. They are responsible for maintaining an overview of the quality of the customer's purchased product offering, and for carrying out QoS performance reviews with the customer, as well as for undertaking any preparatory and/or follow-up steps with other processes/entities in conjunction with such reviews"/>
