      value="The purpose of the Issue Customer Orders processes is to issue correct and complete customer orders. These processes ensure that all necessary information about the Customer Order (for example, type of product, install address, special requirements, etc.) is available. The customer orders may be required to satisfy pertinent customer requests from the Selling processes (in particular taking into account the purchase order from Negotiate Sales), may arise as a result of requests for customer provisioning activity to satisfy customer problem restoration activities, may arise to alleviate customer performance issues. These processes assess the information contained in the customer order relating to the sales request or initiating customer process request to determine the associated customer orders that need to be issued. The issued customer order may require a feasibility assessment, may require new provisioning activities, may require a change to a previously issued customer order, or may require cancellation of a previously initiated customer order. The customer order may also relate to the cancellation of previously purchased specific services. Where, the initiating request for a purchased product offering has a standard customer order this process is responsible for issuing the customer order, and for creating a record of the relevant initiating sales request and the associated customer order. Where the initiating request for a purchased product offering has special or unusual requirements, and a specific feasibility assessment has been previously undertaken, this process is responsible for issuing the customer order, and for creating a record of the relevant initiating request information and the associated customer order. Where the initiating request for a purchased product offering has special or unusual requirements, and a specific feasibility assessment has not been previously undertaken, this process marks the issued customer order as requiring special handling, and passes management for further processing to the Track &amp; Manage Customer Order Handling process. The orchestration, if required, and tracking of the customer order progress is the responsibility of the Track &amp; Manage Customer Order Handling processes."/>
