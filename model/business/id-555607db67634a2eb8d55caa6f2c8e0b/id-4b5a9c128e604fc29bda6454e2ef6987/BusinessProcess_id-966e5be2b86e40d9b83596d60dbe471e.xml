      value="The objective of the Report Customer Bill Inquiry processes is to monitor the status of customer bill inquiries, provide notifications of any changes and provide management reports. These processes are responsible for continuously monitoring the status of customer bill inquiries and managing notifications to other processes and to other parties, including customers, registered to receive notifications of any status changes. Notification lists are managed and maintained by the Support Bill Inquiry Handling processes. These processes record, analyze and assess the customer bill inquiry status changes to provide management reports and any specialized summaries of the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall Bill Inquiry Handling processes. These specialized summaries could be specific reports required by specific audiences and/or customers. These processes also report any identified constraints that can affect customer billing quality standards to other processes. These constraints may include specific resource (billing application and/or database, for example) failures, etc."/>
