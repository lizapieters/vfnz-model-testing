      value="The objective of the Create Service Trouble Report process is to create a new service trouble report. A new service trouble report may be created as a result of service alarm event notification analysis, and subsequent creation of new service alarm event records, undertaken by the Survey &amp; Analyze Service Problem processes, or at the request of analysis undertaken by other processes in the Customer ( in particular a Customer Problem Report can generate one or more Service Trouble Reports), Service or Resource Domains which detect that some form of failure has occurred for which service restoration activity is required to restore normal operation. If the service trouble report is created as a result of a notification or request from processes other than the Survey &amp; Analyze Service Problem processes, the Create Service Trouble Report processes are responsible for converting the received information into a form suitable for the Service Problem Management processes, and for requested additional information if required. These processes will make estimates of the time to restore service which will be included in the new service trouble report so that other processes can gain access to this information."/>
