      value="The purpose of the Allocate Specific Service Parameters to Services processes is to issue service identifiers for new services. Where the Allocate Specific Service Parameters to Services processes are requested by a pre-feasibility service order, or by the Design Services processes, these processes determine whether the requested service parameters are available. Depending on business rules, and on any specific levels of commitment contained in the initiating service order or service design request, these processes may reserve specific service parameters linked to the initiating service order or service design request for a period of time, and releasing them when the time period has expired. These processes are responsible for creating a response to the initiating processes with respect to the feasibility assessment. Where the Allocate Specific Service Parameters to Services processes are requested by a service order issued in response to a confirmed customer order, these processes are responsible for allocating the specific service parameters required to satisfy the initiating service order. Any previously reserved specific service parameters are marked as allocated."/>
