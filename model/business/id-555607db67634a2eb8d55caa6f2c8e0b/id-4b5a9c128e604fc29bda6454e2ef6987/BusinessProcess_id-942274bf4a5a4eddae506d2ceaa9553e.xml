      value="The objective of the Report Service Quality Performance processes is to monitor the status of service performance degradation reports, provide notifications of any changes and provide management reports. These processes are responsible for continuously monitoring the status of service performance degradation reports and managing notifications to other processes in the Service-Ops and other process layers, and to other parties registered to receive notifications of any status changes. Notification lists are managed and maintained by the Enable Service Quality Management processes. These processes record, analyze and assess the service performance degradation report status changes to provide management reports and any specialized summaries of the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall Service Quality Management process. These specialized summaries could be specific reports required by specific audiences. These processes also report any identified constraints that can affect service quality standards to other processes. These constraints may include specific resource failures, capacity shortages due to unexpected demand peaks, etc."/>
