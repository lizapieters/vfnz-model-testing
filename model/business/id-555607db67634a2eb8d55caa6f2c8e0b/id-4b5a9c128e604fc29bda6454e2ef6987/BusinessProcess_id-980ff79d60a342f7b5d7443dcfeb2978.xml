      value="Change Management is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at: http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Change Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases. Change Management optimizes risk exposure, minimize any business disruption and to ensure that anything released into the live environment goes right the first time. With these as the drivers Change Management should reduce risk and therefore deliver direct benefit to the business. Change Management aims to ensure that all changes to the IT infrastructure are assessed and enacted in a controlled manner, i.e.: Standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes All changes to service assets and configuration items are recorded in the Configuration Management System Overall business risk is optimized. The goals of ITIL Change Management are to: Respond to the customerâ€™s changing business requirements while maximizing value and reducing incidents, disruption and re-work Respond to the business and IT requests for change that will align the services with the business needs. The objective of the ITIL Change Management process is to ensure that changes are recorded and then evaluated, authorized, prioritized, planned, tested, implemented, documented and reviewed in a controlled manner. â€¢Terminologyâ€¢ There is no specific eTOM term for changes or associated ITIL terms such as change request, change record, or change advisory board. Instead, eTOM generically refers to â€œchangesâ€� in various processes. ITIL terminology includes: ITIL Change â€“ The actual change that is proposed and possibly carried out is conceptually referred to as an ITIL Change. This is the generic term, which may refer to the ITIL Change Request, ITIL Change Record, the change that is carried out, or all three. ITIL Change Request â€“ All changes are submitted as an ITIL Change Request, which may also be called an ITIL Request for Change. ITIL Change Record â€“ After an ITIL Change Request is submitted and accepted, all documentation related to that ITIL Change Request is captured in an ITIL Change Record. â€¢ ITIL Change Advisory Board â€“ A team that meets to assess an ITIL Change Request and recommend its authorization or rejection.â€¢ ITIL Change Authority â€“ The individual or team that has the power to enact or reject an ITIL Change Request. â€¢ ITIL Standard Change â€“ A well-known type of change for which a simple, straightforward procedure can be carried out to enact the change. These changes are often expedited and do not require explicit authorization. For example, a request to add a user to a security group may be an ITIL Standard Change. It may also be called an ITIL Pre-approved Change. â€¢Linkage with eTOM process areasâ€¢ ITIL Change Management relates to several eTOM process areas.
