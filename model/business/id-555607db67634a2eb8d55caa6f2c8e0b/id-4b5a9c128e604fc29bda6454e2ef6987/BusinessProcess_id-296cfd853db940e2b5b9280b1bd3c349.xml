      value="The responsibility of the Test Resource processes is to test specific resources to ensure they are operating within normal parameters. The objective is to verify whether the resources are working correctly and meet the appropriate performance levels. These processes test specific resources against supplier/partner defined test plans, or against test plans developed by the service provider. Where appropriate test plans are not available these processes are responsible for developing appropriate test plans. These processes are also responsible for capturing and storing the test results for historical and downstream testing comparison purposes. If these tests succeed, the specific resources will be marked as in-service which means the specific resources are available for use."/>
