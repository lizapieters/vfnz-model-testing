      value="The Manage Resource Capability Delivery processes manage the provision, implementation, commissioning and roll-out of the new or enhanced resource capability and associated operational support processes. These processes are predominantly program/project management process functions, and require the detailed management and co-ordination of the delivery of individual resource infrastructure components to achieve the delivery of the overall resource capability.
