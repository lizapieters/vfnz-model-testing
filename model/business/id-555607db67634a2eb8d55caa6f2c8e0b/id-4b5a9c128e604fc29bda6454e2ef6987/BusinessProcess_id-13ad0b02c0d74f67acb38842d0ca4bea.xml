      value="The objective of the Report Service Problem processes is to monitor the status of service trouble reports, provide notifications of any changes and provide management reports. These processes are responsible for continuously monitoring the status of service trouble reports and managing notifications to processes and other parties registered to receive notifications of any status changes, for example, Service Quality Management and Customer QoS/SLA Management processes. Notification lists are managed and maintained by the Support Service Problem Management processes. These processes record, analyze and assess the service trouble report status changes to provide management reports and any specialized summaries of the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall Service Problem Management process. These specialized summaries could be specific reports required by specific audiences. These processes will make the necessary reports about the problem that occurred, the root cause and the activities carried out for restoration."/>
