      value="Receive &amp; Accept Party Order records delivery of a party order and arranges for any acceptance testing or commissioning required. These processes facilitate and support coordination of internal activities with activities performed by the party, that are required to: â€¢ Configure a bought-in party product; â€¢ Bring a bought-in party product into service; or â€¢ Restore a bought-in party product to service. The actual performance of any acceptance testing and/or commissioning activities by the enterprise is managed within the appropriate process(es) as required. These processes also manage negotiations with a party where there have been problems with a party product's supply, and determine through dialogue with the party, how best to resolve such issues. The party delivery acceptance may involve co-ordination with internal processes, where the supplied specific resource, service or product forms part of a composite, or is to be onward shipped. These processes report and document on acceptance, and record final acceptance of party deliveries."/>
