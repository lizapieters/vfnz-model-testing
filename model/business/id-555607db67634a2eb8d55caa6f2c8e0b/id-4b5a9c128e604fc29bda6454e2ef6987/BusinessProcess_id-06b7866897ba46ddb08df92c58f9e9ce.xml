      value="Service Catalog Management is defined within ITIL, and further information is available at: http://www.itsmf.co.uk/Shop/Products/9780113310616TheOfficialIntroductiontotheITILServiceLifecycle.aspx Its role here is as a model or template for how other process areas should operate to align with the ITIL approach, where this is relevant for the enterprise concerned. Note that not all organizations will choose to follow the ITIL approach, and thus other models for Service Catalog Management (or equivalent) may apply in such cases. All operational services and those being prepared for operation are recorded within the Service Catalogue by the Service Catalogue Manager. This information must be accurate and kept up to date. â€¢Terminologyâ€¢ Before considering the terminology of the eTOM and ITIL approaches it is first necessary to contrast the perspectives which each takes of the enterprise. These perspectives affect the concepts and terms used. Due to the nature of the Service Provider enterprise - where SPs typically manage their products, services and resources distinctly - the eTOM is structured into layers (effectively high-level process groupings) which relate to these concerns. These layers are Customer Relationship Management, Service Management and Resource Management. In contrast, ITIL does not have a layered view of this kind. Its perspective is to represent the IT Services and their support, through a lifecycle view built around a set of ITIL processes that address particular, significant, areas of IT capability. It is then a matter for individual users / enterprises to relate these to their businesses. From the eTOM perspective, ITIL Service â€“ compared with SID Resource Facing Service and Customer Facing Service, ITIL Service is defined as services serving one business unit, multiple business units or business external to the enterprise; by convention we should identify the first two as RFS and the latter as CFS. â€¢Linkage with eTOM process areasâ€¢ ITIL Service Catalog Management relates to several eTOM process areas. The eTOM processes affected include: Within Operations: Process Identifier: 1.1.1.1 Process Element: Customer-Ops Support &amp; Readiness Process Impact: Where ITIL Service Catalog Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Customer-Ops Support &amp; Readiness processes operate in line with this. Sales Inventory Database should refer to the Service Catalog in the context of the Operational Support &amp; Readiness. Even if this is not the primary focus of Service Catalog Management but an ancillary activity operator should take into account to make the readiness process consistent across layers. Affected processes are: Manage Sales Inventory: ensure Sales Inventory is properly aligned with Service Inventory for all the relevant common elements Process Identifier: 1.1.2.1 Process Element: Service-Ops Support &amp; Readiness Process Impact: Where ITIL Service Catalog Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Service-Ops Support &amp; Readiness processes operate in line with this. Service Inventory Database should refer to the Service Catalog in the context of the Operational Support &amp; Readiness. This is the primary focus of Service Catalog Management should be integral part of establishing Service Management as an enterprise discipline. Affected processes are: Manage Service Inventory: ensure Service Inventory is properly established, managed and supported Process Identifier: 1.1.3.1 Process Element: Resource-Ops Support &amp; Readiness Process Impact: Where ITIL Service Catalog Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Resource-Ops Support &amp; Readiness processes operate in line with this. Resource Inventory Database should refer to the Service Catalog in the context of the Operational Support &amp; Readiness. Even if this is not the primary focus of Service Catalog Management but an ancillary activity operator should take into account to make the readiness process consistent across layers. Affected processes are: Manage Resource Inventory: ensure Resource Inventory is properly aligned with Service Inventory for all the relevant common elements Process Element: Party Support &amp; Readiness Process Impact: Where ITIL Service Catalog Management is employed as a guiding mechanism, then the Party Support &amp; Readiness processes operate in line with this Party Inventory Database should refer to the Service Catalog in the context of the Operational Support &amp; Readiness. Even if this is not the primary focus of Service Catalog Management but an ancillary activity operator should take into account to make the readiness process consistent across layers. Affected processes are: Manage Party Inventory: ensure Party Inventory is properly aligned with Service Inventory for all the relevant common elements"/>
