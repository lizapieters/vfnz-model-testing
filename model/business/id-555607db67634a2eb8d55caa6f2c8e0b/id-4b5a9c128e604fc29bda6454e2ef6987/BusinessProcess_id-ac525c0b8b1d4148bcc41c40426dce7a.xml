      value="The purpose of the Support Party Performance Management processes is twofold - to manage performance restoration activity with parties who own and manage outsourced infrastructure, and to ensure that the Party Performance Management processes can operate effectively. External parties are engaged by the service provider in infrastructure level performance-related activities when the service provider has outsourced the relevant infrastructure ownership and management to parties (i.e. outsourced network or IT bureau arrangements). The actual engagement with the party is initiated by the specific performance support processes of the Customer-Ops, Service-Ops or Resource-Ops process layers. Where Support Party Performance Management processes are engaged to resolve infrastructure level performance issues, these processes are responsible to ensure on-time and correct resolution and re-establishment of normal infrastructure operation. For the Party Performance Management processes the role of the Support Party Performance Management processes is to ensure that there is capability (for example, information, materials, systems and resources) so that the Party Performance Management processes can operate effectively. The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to: â€¢Arranging and managing party access to appropriate service provider performance management support tools (including any appropriate Inventories) and processes; â€¢Arranging and managing service provider access to appropriate party performance management support tools (including any appropriate Inventories) and processes; â€¢Monitoring and reporting on party progress towards resolving reported infrastructure performance issues; â€¢Initiating reviews and recommendations for party infrastructure performance improvements; â€¢Updating the Party Inventory of any changes to the party infrastructure performance resolution requests and progress; â€¢Updating party product and/or service performance information, etc. to support the Party Requisition Management processes â€¢Undertaking and reporting on, trend analysis on Party Performance Management processes, including types of associated performance resolution requests, response duration, delays and other process measures. â€¢"/>
