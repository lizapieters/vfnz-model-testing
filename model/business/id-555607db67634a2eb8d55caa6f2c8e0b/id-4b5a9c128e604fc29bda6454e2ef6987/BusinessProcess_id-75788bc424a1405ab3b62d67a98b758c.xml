      value="The purpose of the Authorize Customer Bill Invoice Adjustment processes is to adjust the customer's bill invoice based on detailed assessment and/or policy. The responsibilities of this process include, but are not limited to: - Determination of whether policy allows for automated adjustment of the customer bill invoice, and approving any resultant adjustments; - Undertaking more detailed analysis and investigation to determine whether a bill adjustment is acceptable, including gaining appropriate management authority to make the adjustment - Recording the results of the adjustment if approved into the records relating to the customerâ€™s bill invoice. These processes rely on the availability of appropriate adjustment policies, which are created within the Support Bill Inquiry Handling processes, for the timely resolution of major billing disputes. The resolution processes may require investigation of the billing processes themselves to determine whether the disputed bills are the result of quality errors within the Service Provider processes."/>
