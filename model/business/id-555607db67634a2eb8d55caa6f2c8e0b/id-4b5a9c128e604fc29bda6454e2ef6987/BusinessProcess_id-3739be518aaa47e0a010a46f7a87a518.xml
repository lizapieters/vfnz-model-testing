      value="The purpose of this process is to close the sale with terms that are understood by the customer, and are mutually agreeable to both the customer and the service provider. This process may involve obtaining customer agreement to standard terms and conditions. The agreement process may require interaction with the customer to ensure that the standard terms and conditions are understood by, and are acceptable to, the customer. In some cases this process may involve the development of, and negotiation with the customer of, non-standard terms and conditions associated with sales proposals specifically developed to meet specific customer requirements. For complex sales proposals associated with customer RFPs this process may extend over long time periods and require extensive interaction with customers to achieve agreement. Aspects of contract price determination may include issues of CPE prices from third party vendors, allowances based on customer location, etc. For RFPs, many of the commercial terms being sought may be developed or originated by the customer, and the negotiating team may need to develop strategies to achieve acceptable commercial outcomes. .The sale is concluded through negotiations and joint agreement on features, service levels, pricing and discounts, resulting in a sign-off formal agreement/contract between the customer and service provider. Depending upon specific circumstances, final agreement from the Service Providerâ€™s perspective may require escalation to, and agreement from, an appropriately delegated manager. The formal agreement could include zero or more confirmed orders from the customer. These orders are then passed on as requests to allow formal Customer Orders to be generated and processed...

The agreement process may require interaction with the party to ensure that the standard terms and conditions are understood by, and are acceptable to, them. In some cases this process may involve the development of, and negotiation with a party of, non-standard terms and conditions associated with sales proposals specifically developed to meet specific party requirements. For complex sales proposals associated with customer RFPs this process may extend over long time periods and require extensive interaction with a customer to achieve agreement.

The formal agreement could include zero or more confirmed order requests from a party. These requests are then passed to other processes to allow formal party or customer orders to be generated and processed. Note that the Party Agreement Management process manages the lifecycle of the agreement, such as negotiating and approving it."/>
