It determines the root causes of specific resource performance degradations and violations, records the results of the analysis and intermediate updates in the Resource Inventory for historical analysis and for use as required by other processes, and undertakes specific detailed analysis (if the original requested came from Service Quality Management processes) to discover the root cause of customer QoS performance degradations that may be arising due to interactions between resource instances, without any specific resource instance having an unacceptable performance in its own right.">
