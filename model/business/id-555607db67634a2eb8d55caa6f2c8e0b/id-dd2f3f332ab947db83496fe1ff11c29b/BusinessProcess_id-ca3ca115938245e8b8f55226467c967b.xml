      value="Authorize Party Bill Invoice Adjustment adjusts a party's bill/invoice based on a detailed assessment and/or policy. The responsibilities of this process include, but are not limited to: - Determining whether policy allows for automated adjustment of a party bill/invoice, and approving any resultant adjustments - Undertaking more detailed analysis and investigation to determine whether a bill adjustment is acceptable, including gaining appropriate management authority to make the adjustment - Making an approved adjustment to a partyâ€™s bill/invoice. This process relies on the availability of appropriate adjustment policies, which are created within the Support Bill Inquiry Handling processes, for the timely resolution of major billing disputes. This form of resolution may require investigation of the billing/invoicing processes themselves to determine whether the disputed bills are the result of quality errors within an enterprise's processes."/>
