It manages the process to exit it from the market. It analyzes an existing loyalty program to identify if it is economically or strategically, identify participants impacted by any exit, develop participant specific exit or migration strategies, develop infrastructure transition and/or replacement strategies, and manage the operational aspects of the exit process.

It includes any interaction with cross-enterprise co-ordination and management functions to ensure that the needs of all stakeholders are identified and managed.
