A key element of the overall design is the integration approach between the existing legacy resource infrastructure and any proposed new resource infrastructure. This integration design is managed within the architecture and specification processes.&#xA;Note that the actual management of the sourcing process is handled within the Supply Chain Development &amp; Management processes.">
