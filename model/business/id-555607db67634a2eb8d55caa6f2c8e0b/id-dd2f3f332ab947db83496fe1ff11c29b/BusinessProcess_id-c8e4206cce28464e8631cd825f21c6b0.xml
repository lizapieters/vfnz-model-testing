      value="Apply Party Pricing, Discounting, Adjustments &amp; Rebates ensures that the bill/invoice is reflective of all the commercially agreed billable events and any bill/invoice adjustments agreed between an enterprise and a party. In addition, it ensures that the appropriate taxes, rebates (such as missed party commitments) and credits are applied to a partyâ€™s bill/invoice(s). This process applies account and party specific pricing, charges, discounting, credits and taxation for products delivered to parties by an enterprise. It accepts events that have been collected, translated, correlated, assembled, guided and product rated. It takes these events and determines account or party specific pricing, charges, discounts, and taxation that should be delivered to the bills/invoice(s) for the party. It reviews any agreed adjustments agreed in the previous billing cycle and includes these in the bill/invoice. This process can execute in real-time as events are product rated, or can be on a scheduled on a periodic basis at an enterpriseâ€™s discretion"/>
