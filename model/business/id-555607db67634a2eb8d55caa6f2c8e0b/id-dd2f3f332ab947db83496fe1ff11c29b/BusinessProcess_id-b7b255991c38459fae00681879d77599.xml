The adjustments are communicated to the Modify Engaged Element process. For example, a SP operating a mobile network may decompose its network resource into 3 elements: transmission, cells and facilities such as power. The shared goal for network upgrades may be to align these 3 elements such that all are upgraded at the same time."/>
