      value="Off-Board Party Product Specification off-boards a party's product specification and related product specification tests. This can occur when the agreement for this product specification is terminated or an item on an agreement associated with the specification for this product offering is terminated. When a product specification is off-boarded then disposition of related service specifications, services, resource specifications, and/or resources is made. The off-boarding of the specifications and retirement of the product specification by the enterprise is gradual. This allows enough time to account for any contractual obligations of the enterprise with its customers, but without violating the terms and conditions of agreements with the party."/>
