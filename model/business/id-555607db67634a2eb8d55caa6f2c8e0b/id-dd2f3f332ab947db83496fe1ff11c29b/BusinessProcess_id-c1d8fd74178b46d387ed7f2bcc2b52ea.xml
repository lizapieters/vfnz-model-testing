      value="These processes manage the collection of the specific requirements and timetable to be achieved from the sourcing process. These requirements take into account the required functional, technical and/or operational specifications produced by the area seeking the sourcing activity and assuring that appropriately aligned commercial aspects (such as special commercial terms, tender timing, cost parameters, etc.) are catered for. The requirements will be determined from the requirements specified in the various business or investment proposals, and any subsequent detailed specifications developed as a part of the architecture design activity, within the product, market, service or resource capability delivery processes. The actual range of requirements are dependent on the needs of the sourcing initiator, but are likely to include, at a minimum, technical, operational, training and specific supplier support requirements. Detailed analysis of new resource requirements linked to relevant geographic distributions. These processes also establish the detailed performance requirements....much of the following about demand and capacity is performed by P/S/R Capability Delivery processes...so it should reference them rather than duplicating the tasks performed by them... These processes take the forecast information available from the Produce Resource Business Plans and requirements information from the Map &amp; Analyze Service Requirements processes, as well as resource infrastructure requirements developed by the Develop Detailed Resource Specifications processes, to establish detailed views of anticipated resource demand and performance requirements. These processes manage the capacity planning for the resource infrastructure, and identify capacity requirements based on service forecasts and appropriate resource related metrics, i.e., transaction volumes, storage requirements, traffic volumes, port availabilities, etc. The Party Strategy and Planning processes will also provide a set of enterprise level requirements that the sourcing process will need to satisfy."/>
