      value="Define Configuration Specification adds a configuration specification, configuration parameters, any configuration constraints, policies associated with the configuration specification, and relationships between/among configuration specifications. Configuration specifications define how an entity, such as a product, service, or resource can be configured in order for it to function properly. There are often many configuration specifications that can be chosen. A policy can be defined to assist with or to make the choice. Configuration parameters are attributes that provide details on how an entity will function. The choice of an attribute's value can be determined by defining a constraint. Relationships between/among configuration specifications define such things as the sequence in which configurations must be made. For example, if multiple services must be configured to realize a product there is often a sequence in which the services must be configured."/>
