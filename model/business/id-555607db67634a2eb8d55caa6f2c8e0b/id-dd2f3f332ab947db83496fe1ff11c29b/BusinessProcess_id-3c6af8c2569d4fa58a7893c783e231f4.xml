The required performance standards are driven by community and regulatory expectations, internal process and technology capabilities and competitive offerings. These processes also provide the feedback point from analyses undertaken in the resource Management &amp; Operations process to determine bottlenecks and problems associated with existing resource operational activities. A major input to these processes arises from the Gather &amp; Analyze Service Information processes, and from the product portfolio, resource strategy and market strategy processes."/>
