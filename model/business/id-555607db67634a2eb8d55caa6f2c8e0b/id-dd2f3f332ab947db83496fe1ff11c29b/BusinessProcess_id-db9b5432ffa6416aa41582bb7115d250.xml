It validates that the customer is capable of realizing maximum value from the operation or use of the solution and that intense Provider involvement is no longer needed to manage the solution. This process ensures that the customer is satisfied that the solution that was actually delivered meets original or updated expectations and agreements and that the solution is operable by the customer."/>
