      value="Manage Party Bill/Invoice Archive Additionally temporarily stores a party bill/invoice for a period of time to address regulation and/or internal requirements, during which it can be accessed to support any party or regulator agency inquiries about a bill/invoice. It handles the receipt and query of a regulatory/government request or from some other party (internal and external), fulfilling the information request (either predetermined or unique) for a specific party. This can be due to bankruptcy or investigations of other nature, and may lead to the providing financial information for a party. Typically the bills/invoices over a given period, such as a year, are requested, but the requests can be varied in nature, for example balances, payment regularity, and so forth. These processes are usually only known to people with sufficient security clearance."/>
