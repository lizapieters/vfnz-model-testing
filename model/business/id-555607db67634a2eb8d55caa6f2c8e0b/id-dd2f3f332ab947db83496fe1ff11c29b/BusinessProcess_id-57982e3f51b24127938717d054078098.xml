    documentation="Focus or broaden the customer base via investigating new markets, as well as different products and services for the enterprise. The focus is on broadening the scope of the enterprise activities through expansion, or sharpening the enterprise focus through divestment or outsourcing of non-critical activities.  The Marketing &amp; Offer Management processes are responsible for the development of markets and products within the existing scope of the enterprise. Business Development processes understand what processes are critical to the identity of the enterprise as priority processes and look for higher quality and lower cost solutions for these high priority processes.  Business Development processes are closely related to Strategic Planning.">
