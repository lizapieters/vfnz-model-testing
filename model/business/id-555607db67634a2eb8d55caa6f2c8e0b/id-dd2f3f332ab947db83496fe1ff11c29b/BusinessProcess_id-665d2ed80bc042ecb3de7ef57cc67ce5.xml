      value="Product Offering Prototyping iteratively develops a product offering. Product Offering Development &amp; Retirement processes develop each iteration of the offering to a state that enables it to be tested in some way by the Product Offering Development &amp; Retirementâ€™s Conduct Product Offering Acceptance Testing process. Tests can be conducted internally, in the form of a pilot, or field trial. Tests are measured against defined acceptance criteria. Identified improvements/enhancements are made during the next iteration based on test results. Once the final iteration tests are accepted the offering is rolled out and launched to the market at large. Note: This process is not further decomposed, because the process uses existing Product Offering Development &amp; Retirement processes."/>
