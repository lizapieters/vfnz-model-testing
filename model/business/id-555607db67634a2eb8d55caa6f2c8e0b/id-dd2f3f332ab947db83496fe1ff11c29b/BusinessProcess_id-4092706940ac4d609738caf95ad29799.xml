It determines the root causes of specific service performance degradations and violations, records the results of the analysis and intermediate updates in the Service Inventory for historical analysis and for use as required by other processes, and undertakes specific detailed analysis (if the original requested came from Customer QoS/SLA Management processes) to discover the root cause of customer QoS performance degradations that may be arising due to interactions between service instances, without any specific service instance having an unacceptable performance in its own right.">
