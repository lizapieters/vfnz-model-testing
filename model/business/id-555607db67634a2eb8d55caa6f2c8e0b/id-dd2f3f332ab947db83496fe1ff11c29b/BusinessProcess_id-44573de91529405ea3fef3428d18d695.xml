The required performance standards are driven by community expectations, internal process and technology capabilities and competitive offerings. These processes also provide the feedback point from analyses undertaken in the Service Management &amp; Operations process to determine bottlenecks and problems associated with existing service support activities. A major input to these processes arises from the Gather &amp; Analyze Service Information processes, and from the product portfolio, resource strategy and market strategy processes."/>
