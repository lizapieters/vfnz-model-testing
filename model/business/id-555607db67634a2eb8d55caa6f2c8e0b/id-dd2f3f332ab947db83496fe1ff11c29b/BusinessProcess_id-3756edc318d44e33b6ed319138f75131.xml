Following on from this, processes are put in place to manage the resolution of the performance violation The Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Operations processes will continue to track the revenue and cost assurance trouble report, ensuring that performance is restored to a level required as defined by the acceptable range for the KPIs."/>
