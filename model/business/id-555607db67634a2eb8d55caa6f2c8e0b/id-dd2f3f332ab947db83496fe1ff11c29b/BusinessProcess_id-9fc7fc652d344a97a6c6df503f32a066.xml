    documentation="These processes ensure the provision, implementation and roll-out of the new or enhanced resource capability and associated operational support processes. These processes are predominantly program/project management process functions, and require the detailed management and co-ordination of the delivery of individual resource infrastructure components, and any underlying resource infrastructure capability delivery, to achieve the delivery of the overall resource capability. Within these processes, separate other parties may be responsible for the delivery of the resource capability, and other  parties for the installation and construction. These processes ensure that the roles and responsibilities of all parties are identified, managed and coordinated.">
