Every organization's trust capital is based on their knowledge of parties they interact with. If interactions are to be managed, the organization needs to be clear as to who other parties are, and ensure that the identity they carry is valid for the business purpose intended. Authentication and assigning of privileges are key interactions between the organization and the party, and are logged in for security control purpose."/>
