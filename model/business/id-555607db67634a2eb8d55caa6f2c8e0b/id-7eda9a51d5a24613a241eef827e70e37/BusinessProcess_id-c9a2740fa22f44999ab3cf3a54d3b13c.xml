      value="The purpose of Charging is to assign a value (monetary or other) to an event or product, or combination (bundle or aggregate) of the above. The charge may be either a credit or a debit and can be handled either online or offline. Online charging is performed in real-time, requiring an authorization component which may affect how the service is rendered and enables an operator to provide prepaid services to its customers. Whereas offline charging is performed after the service is rendered and is not required to be done in real-time and generally relates to subscription based products. The charge may appear on a customer invoice via Apply Pricing, Discounting, Adjustments &amp; Rebates."/>
