      value="Service Guiding &amp; Mediation processes manage usage events by correlating and formatting them into a useful format. These processes include guiding resource events to an appropriate service, mediation of these usage records, as well as de-duplication of usage records already processed. These processes provide information on customer-related and Service-related events to other process areas across assurance and billing. This includes reports on non-chargeable events and overcharged events and analysis of event records to identify fraud and prevent further occurrences. In many cases, this process is performed by a resource such as a network element."/>
