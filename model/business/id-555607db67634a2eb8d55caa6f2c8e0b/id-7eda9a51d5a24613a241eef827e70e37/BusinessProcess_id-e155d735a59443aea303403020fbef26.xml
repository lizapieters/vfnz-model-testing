      value="The purpose of the Pricing, Discounting, Adjustments &amp; Rebates Application process is to ensure that the bill invoice is reflective of all the commercially agreed billable events and any bill invoice adjustments agreed between a Service Provider and the customer. In addition, it ensures that the appropriate taxes, rebates (i.e. missed customer commitments) and credits are applied to the customerâ€™s bill invoice(s). This process contains the account and customer specific pricing, charges, discounting, credits and taxation for services delivered to the customer by the Service Provider. It accepts events that have been collected, translated, correlated, assembled, guided and service rated. It takes these events and determines the account or customer specific pricing, charges, discounts, and taxation that should be delivered to the invoice(s) for the customer. It reviews any agreed adjustments agreed in the previous billing period and includes these to the bill invoice. This process can occur in real-time as events are service rated, or can be on a scheduled on a periodic basis at the Service Providerâ€™s discretion."/>
