      value="Configuration Specification and Configuration Management defines, modifies, and removes a configuration specification that defines how an entity, such as a product, service, or resource functions. This process also configures or creates a new version of a configuration for an entity, such as a product, service, or resource, as defined by a configuration specification. It also modifies a configuration and values for configuration parameters, and removes a configuration. Domain specific configuration management processes, such as Product Configuration Management contain only the processes specific to them. For example, associating a product specification with product configuration specification and a product with a product configuration. Generalized processes such as this eliminate redundant processes used to create domain specific configuration management processes."/>
