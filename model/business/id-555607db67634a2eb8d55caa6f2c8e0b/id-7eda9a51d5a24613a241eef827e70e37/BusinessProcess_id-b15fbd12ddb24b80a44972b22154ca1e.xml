      value="Domain Orchestration process performs cross- and intra-domain coordination and alignment. For example, a Service Provider orchestrating the customer journey for technician visits may use the Domain Orchestration process to coordinate and align elements such as technician current location, maps, GPS and app to appraise customer of likely time of technician arrival. Elements may be in different domains, the same domain or elements may be domains themselves. The definition of &quot;Elements&quot; is purposely broad to allow a wide range of Use Cases. Elements to be orchestrated are to be specified by the eTOM practitioner on a case-by-case basis. The definition of &quot;Element&quot; includes, but is not limited to: a domain, a process, a person (including staff), a group of people, an organizational department and an asset, whether tangible (such as network or ecosystem) or intangible (such as information and intangible ecosystems)."/>
