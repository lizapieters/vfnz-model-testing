The configuration for a product, which is also managed by this process, is governed by a selected product configuration specification. A feature/property specified by Product Offering Purchasing and/or Product Lifecycle Management is also considered to be a configuration parameter. Note that this process reuses a set of generalized configuration management processes to create a configuration specification and a configuration that can also be used to manage a service configuration specification and service configuration as well as a resource configuration specification and resource configuration. The focus of this process is to define a product configuration specification and a product configuration."/>
