      value="Resource Performance Management processes encompass managing, tracking, monitoring, analyzing, controlling and reporting on the performance of specific resources. They work with basic information received from the Resource Data Collection &amp; Distribution processes. If the analysis identifies a resource performance violation or a potential service performance violation, information will be passed to Resource Trouble Management and/or Service Quality Management as appropriate. The latter processes are responsible for deciding on and carrying out the appropriate action/response. This may include requests to the Resource Performance Management processes to install controls to optimize the specific resource performance. The Resource Performance Management processes will continue to track the resource performance problem, ensuring that resource performance is restored to a level required to support services."/>
