      value="Party Problem Handling ensures the timely and effective resolution of all party problems initiated by an enterprise or initiated by another party, such as a partner. External parties may report discovered problems to an enterprise which may impact product, resources, services and/or customers. It includes the receiving and sending party problems regarding a product, managing the entire problem lifecycle, reporting changes to and updates to, and closure of a problem when all activities have been completed.
