      value="Cramming is a form of fraud in which small (often indiscernible) charges are added to a bill by a third party without the subscriber's consent or disclosure. These may be disguised as a tax or some other common fee, and may be several euros/dollars/ other currency or even just a few cents. This process describes the actions that are taken towards the 1) partner, 2) affected partners 3) public communication.
