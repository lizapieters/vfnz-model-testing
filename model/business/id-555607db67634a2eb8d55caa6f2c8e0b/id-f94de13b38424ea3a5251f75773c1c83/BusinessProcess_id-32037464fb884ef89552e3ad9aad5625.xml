      value="Assign Privileges to Parties is responsible to set the party's level of privileges. Note: A parties' ability to interact with an organization is bounded by the privileges the organization assigns to the party. While privileges are defined by strategy, policy and intent, they have a profound impact on the parties' experience of the organization, and thus need to be assigned with care. Privileges are typically assigned to a parties identity, and are accessed from the context of that identity."/>
