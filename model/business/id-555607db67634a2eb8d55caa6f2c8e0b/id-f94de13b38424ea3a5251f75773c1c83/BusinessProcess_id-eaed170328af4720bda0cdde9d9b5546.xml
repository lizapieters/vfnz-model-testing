      value="Provide Loyalty Program Invitation communicates an invitation to a party suggesting they join a loyalty program. The invitation can be made when a party, such as a customer or partner, initially engages with an enterprise. For example, when a customer creates an online account they could be immediately asked if there is a desire to join a loyalty program. If a party does not join when initially engaging with an enterprise an invitation may be communicated to them at a later time. Note that if invitations were not sent to applicable existing parties during the development of a loyalty program this process is responsible for doing so."/>
