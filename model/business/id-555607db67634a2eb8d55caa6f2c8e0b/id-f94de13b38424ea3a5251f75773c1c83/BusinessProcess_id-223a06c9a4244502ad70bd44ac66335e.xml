      value="Join Loyalty Program enables a party to establish themselves as a loyalty program participant and establish a loyalty program account. A loyalty program ID may be issued by an enterprise, or a party may be able to create their own ID. A participant may also be required to accept a standard loyalty program agreement's terms &amp; conditions. Existing information about a party can be used to establish the participant. A profile can be created for the participant by interacting with the Party Relationship &amp; Development process. For example, suppose an enterprise has an agreement with a partner that allows a participant to earn currency in the partner's loyalty program; the participant may choose as a default to earn currency in the partner's program. Note that the sub-processes also update and remove information about a participant."/>
