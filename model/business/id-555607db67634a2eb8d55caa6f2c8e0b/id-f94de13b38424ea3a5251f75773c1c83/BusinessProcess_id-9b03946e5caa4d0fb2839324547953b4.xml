      value="Welcome New Party provides an initial welcome to the party with whom a relationship has started. The welcome may be communicated in a number of ways, such as a phone call, email, or visit to a party. A visit may be used if a party is considered to be one in a top tier, such as a customer or partner who will contribute a significant amount of revenue to an enterprise. Scheduling, conducting, next steps, and evaluating a meeting are the responsibility of a appointment/calendaring process that would reside in Enterprise domain/Common Enterprise Processes; it has yet to be developed. The communication would include: -Executive &amp; team introduction -Access/explanation to the further on-boarding process -Access to partner portal The communication should provide the right level of detail to get the new party started without being overwhelming."/>
