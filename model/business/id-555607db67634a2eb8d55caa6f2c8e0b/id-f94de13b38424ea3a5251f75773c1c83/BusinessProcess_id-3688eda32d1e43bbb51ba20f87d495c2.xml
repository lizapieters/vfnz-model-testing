      value="Develop New Product Offering Business Proposal develops and documents business proposals for the identified new product offering concept (including if necessary a business case). The business proposal (or business case) identifies the new product offering requirements, including the possible sales channels that will deliver the offerings to customers and locations for which the offering is available. The business proposal also identifies the development costs and anticipated benefits, including forecast demand, revenue gains, productivity gains, performance improvements and/or operational cost improvements. In addition, these processes define the attributes specific to product offering, as defined by the associated product specification, and used for advertising and sales. The business proposal also includes an assessment of the risks and the competitive positioning of the product offering proposal. As a part of the business proposal development a feasibility assessment can be produced. Potential other parties who can assist in the development of the product offering are also identified via interaction with the Determine Potential Parties sub-process within Party Tender Management. As a part of the process, the business proposal is appropriately approved, and as a result of the approval, necessary resources are made available."/>
