      value="Algorithmic Product Offering Pricing develops (creates, modifies, deletes) a product offering pricing algorithmic matrix specification and the content of the matrix. The matrix is used to determine the price to charge/allow for a product that meet the criteria in the matrix, particularly for variable charges/allowances. For example, the amount to charge for data usage for some period. Matrix specification development includes defining the matrix and its rows and columns. The rows and columns represent the criteria evaluated to determine the charge/allowance. They represent such things as types of product features/properties, types of product offering prices, algorithmic specific criteria such as type of customer, and so forth. Matrix development defines a matrix based on a matrix specification, the content of matrix cells, as well as the product offering to which it applies. The cells represent the values for the product features/properties, such as excess data usage rates, product offering prices that will be charged/allowed, and values for algorithmic evaluation such as student, normal, or very important person (VIP) types of customers. As with other pricing processes this process interacts with the Provide Product Offering Price Notification and Obtain Product Offering Price Approval processes to provide notifications and gain approval of any actions taken by this process. Note that this process is meant to use/interact with generic property/feature processes to define them. To date the generic processes have not yet been developed."/>
