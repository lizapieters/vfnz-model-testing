      value="Develop Detailed Product Commercial Specifications develops the product specification, which also includes grouping/bundling of specifications and versioning of the specifications. Groups/bundles may include specifications on-boarded from other parties. Required non-configurable features known as characteristics are developed. The process also associates the specification with one or more product lines and/or product categories. If a product line or category does not exist one is created. Associations to suggested pricing for product offerings based on the specification are also developed. Associations between and among product specifications are developed. These associations represent business rules, such as migration, substitution, dependency, or exclusivity between and among the specifications. The process ensures that all detailed specifications are produced and appropriately documented. Additionally the processes ensure that the documentation is captured in an appropriate enterprise repository. Note: To minimize the number of sub-processes that update and remove various aspects of a product specification, such as groupings and features, it is assumed that the sub-processes also perform updates and removals."/>
