Additionally the processes ensure that the documentation is captured in an appropriate enterprise repository. Note: To minimize the number of sub-processes that update and remove various aspects of a product offering, such as features and associated sales channels and locations, it is assumed that the &quot;develop&quot; processes also perform updates and removals."/>
