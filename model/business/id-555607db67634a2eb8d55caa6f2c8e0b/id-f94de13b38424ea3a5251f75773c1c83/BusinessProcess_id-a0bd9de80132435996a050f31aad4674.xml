Because different forms of information can be provided by a party other processes may be involved. For example, if an bill/invoice is provided by a party then the Party Bill Inquiry Handling process may be invoked; if a payment is provided then the Party Payment Handling process may be invoked; if a revenue share notification is provided then the Identify Party Revenue Share Adjustment process may be invoked."/>
