Based on the analysis of a prospect's needs, one or more potential product offerings are identified from an enterprise's product catalog to recommend to a prospect. The product offerings may be in addition or different than the offerings in which a prospect expressed interest. For example the offering or offerings may represent upselling/cross selling; it may be that a customized offering is needed. If this is the case then the solution is further analyzed by the Selling process. Initiate Interaction With Sales Prospect triggers an interaction with a party to communicate the suggested offering(s) to a party."/>
