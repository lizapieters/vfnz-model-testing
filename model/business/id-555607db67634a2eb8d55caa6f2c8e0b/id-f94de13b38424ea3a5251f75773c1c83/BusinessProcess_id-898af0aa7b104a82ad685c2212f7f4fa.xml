      value="Apply Product Price applies a product price to a product. The price may be influenced directly or indirectly by a policy. A price may be a single price, a group of prices, or part of the group. For example, a group may consist of a recurring payment for base usage of the product, such as the number of times medical information can be sent to a doctor each month, and another price for any usage that exceeds the base. The price may also be dependent on a policy or a policy may determine another price to apply to the product or some other product. For example, viewing more than a defined number of videos may result in a free view for a family member. Policies are defined when the product offering is developed and associated with an item on a product offering purchase."/>
