      value="Apply Party Payment applies a party payment to referenced to bill(s), charge(s), payment plan(s) accompanying the payment or apply them to outstanding bill(s), charge(s), purchase(s), payment plan(s) if there are no references. Payment items may be created if the inbound payment is one that is made for an account or party in general with no specific bill(s), charge(s), or payment plan(s) referenced. Application is made according to established rules defined by the receiving party. If the payment is made against a payment plan the payment is applied against the charge(s)/bill(s)/invoice(s), purchase(s) associated with the payment plan. This process also handles payments that cannot be applied, sometimes referred to as &quot;fallout&quot;. This may involve contacting the party who sent the payment or internally investigating the reason why a payment cannot be applied."/>
