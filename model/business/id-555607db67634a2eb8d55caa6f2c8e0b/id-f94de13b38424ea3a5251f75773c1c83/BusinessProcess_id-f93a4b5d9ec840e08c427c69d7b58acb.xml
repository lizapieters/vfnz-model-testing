      value="The management and control of fraud classification information is an ongoing effort within any operator. Not only is this information constantly growing internally within any given operator, but the available information externally is growing even more rapidly (other operators, industry standards and bodies, LEAs, etc.). Management of this information is critical to the success and efficiency of any fraud protection program. Internal management tasks: 1. Collection and version control of detected and confirmed frauds 2. Management of M&amp;Ps (Methods and Procedures) around each fraud type to: a. Detect (e.g., applicable rules) b. Investigate c. Resolve (external interactions with LEAs, service interruptions, etc.) External management tasks: 1. Access to fraud classifications and detection practices within the industry 2. Access to fraud types that do not match the operatorâ€™s business model - fraud appearing in mobile technology may soon arrive in varied form in IPTV, for instance. Access to a â€œlibraryâ€� of other fraud information will only benefit an operator over time. Examples that may be shared within a library include: a. Hotlist B Database b. New fraud patterns c. New security and/or business loopholes exploited by fraudsters"/>
