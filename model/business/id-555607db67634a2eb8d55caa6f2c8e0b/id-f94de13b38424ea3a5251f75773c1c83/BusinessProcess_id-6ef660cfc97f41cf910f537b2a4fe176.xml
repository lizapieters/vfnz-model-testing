      value="Define Loyalty Program Interaction Plan defines the various ways participants interact with a loyalty program and the ways in which an enterprise interacts with participants. Inbound interactions include the determining the channels used to serve participants, such as phone, web site, or outsourced channels. In the case of outsourced channels Party Tender Management and/or Party Agreement Management processes are used to identify and enter into an agreement with a partner who will serve participants. Inbound interactions also include how participants will redeem loyalty program rewards and report problems. Outbound interactions include how, when, and why loyalty program participants will be contacted by an enterprise and the purpose of the communication. For example, if a participant moves from one tier to the next a congratulatory letter or email may be sent, or phone call may be made; a welcome package, including a membership card, may be sent to a new participant. - What will be our contact strategy for our program members? - How do you build evangelists?"/>
