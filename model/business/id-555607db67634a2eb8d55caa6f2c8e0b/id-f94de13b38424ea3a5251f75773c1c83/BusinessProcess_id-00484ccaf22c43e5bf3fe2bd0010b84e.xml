      value="Add Configuration Specification Constraint adds a rule that is used to determine whether a configuration specification or a value for a configuration attribute should be applied when configuring an entity, such as a product, service, or resource. The rule is comprised of elements/members that when taken together define the rule. For example, an member may include an operator, such as less than, and an attribute, such as key quality indicator, in a rule that defines how a service is configured based on various key quality indicators contained in a service level agreement. This rule may determine a configuration specification to use or the value of an configuration specification parameter that should be used."/>
