      value="Assess Party Bill/Invoice compares a party bill/invoice against purchases from the party, usage records and offsets, and any other transactions with the party that would result in a bill/invoice being sent to the enterprise. For a bill/invoice for products that were provided by a party on behalf of an enterprise this process verifies whether it was done on their behalf. For example that a party belongs the enterprise. This process also manages the interactions between the party and the enterprise to confirm bill/invoice items. If the bill/invoice is related to revenue sharing then the Party Revenue Sharing Reconciliation process is used to assess and negotiate the bill/invoice."/>
