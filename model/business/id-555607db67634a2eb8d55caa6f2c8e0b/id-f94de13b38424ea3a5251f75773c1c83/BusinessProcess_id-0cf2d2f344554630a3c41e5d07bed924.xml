      value="Perform Party Problem Product Diagnostic Test performs diagnostic testing based on party provided information to determine whether the root cause of a problem is linked to the underlying services and or resources used to realize a product. Since a product can only be tested by testing the underlying services and/or resources used to realize a product this process interacts with service(s) and/or resource(s) test processes to perform one or more tests. The results of any tests performed may result in service(s) and/resource(s) being reconfigured to bring the product back into a useful state. For resource(s) replacements of them may be necessary. These processes communicate the results back to this process. This process then may notifies the Identify Party Problem Root Cause that underlying service(s) and/or resource(s) was the root cause of a party problem."/>
