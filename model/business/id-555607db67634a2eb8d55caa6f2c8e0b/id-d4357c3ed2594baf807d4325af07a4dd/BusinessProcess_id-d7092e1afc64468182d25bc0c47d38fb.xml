      value="Execute Party Billing on Behalf process describes parties who externally perform â€˜billing on behalf ofâ€™(BOBO) an enterprise. The enterprise â€œbuysâ€� the â€œbilling service skillâ€� from BOBO vendor and can therefore save the overhead of maintaining such infrastructure, staff, licenses, skill. The BOBO vendor only charges for the service of drafting a bill but not the revenue generated on that bill. The enterprise and BOBO vendor exchange the usage and latest customer details, for example whatever is required for rating/pricing calculations if the calculations is part of the agreement with the BOBO vendor, details of the customer's products and their postal address. The invoices/bills are generated by BOBO vendor as if the original enterprise had done them internally. The BOBO vendor will usually not have any of its details present on the invoice. The BOBO vendor is providing a transparent 'back office' billing function that the end customer is unaware of. There are no explicit contractual relationship between the BOBO provider and the party that receives the bill/invoice."/>
