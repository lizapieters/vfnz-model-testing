      value="Create Configuration Specification Constraint Member adds a member of a constraint that represents a component of a configuration specification constraint. The member can represent another configuration parameter or some other attribute. Note that this process also uses a generalized set of processes to create the other attribute, called characteristics. To date the generic processes have not yet been developed. For example, an member may include an operator, such as less than, and an attribute, such as key quality indicator, in a rule that defines how a service is configured based on various key quality indicators contained in a service level agreement."/>
