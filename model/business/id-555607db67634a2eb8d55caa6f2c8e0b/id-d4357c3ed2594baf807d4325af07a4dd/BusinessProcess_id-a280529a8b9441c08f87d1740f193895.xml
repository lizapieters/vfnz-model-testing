      value="Define Loyalty Program Earning Methods specifies how a program's currency is earned by a participant. For example, one point may be earned for each dollar spent by a customer or sold by a partner or via an enterprise's marketplace; an upper tier participant may earn bonus currency based on their tier. The earning method is often based on a policy associated with an enterprise's product offering. This process defines the rule (policy) its conditions and actions, execution point, and event(s) that trigger(s) evaluation of the rule. Note that this process is meant to use generic policy processes to define the base policy. These processes represent loyalty program specific extensions to them. To date the generic processes have not yet been developed."/>
