    documentation="Taxation module in Billing System allows to calculate tax for each charge. Taxation is defined using following configuration:&#xA;1.&#x9;In the Billing System the Tax jurisdiction determines an area within which specific taxes are calculated. &#xA;2.&#x9;Taxes imposed by tax government institutions are defined within tax jurisdictions. A term tax is defined as a tax itself plus a valid rate of the given tax.&#xA;3.&#x9;Within a tax rule there are defined factors such as: jurisdiction for a given address, tax group for payments, etc. A rule returns a list of taxes (more precisely a list of tax rates), which are calculated provided that the given rule fulfilled the premises from charge. &#xA;4.&#x9;Finding the most proper rule takes place during the rating of event records. However, the actual calculation of tax values takes place during the invoice generation process, based on the previously selected rule Id.&#xA;5.&#x9;Validity dates can be defined in Billing System for the taxation rules. For example, if it will be known that new tax rate will be introduced in the future or existing rate will be changed, the tax configuration can be updated beforehand with proper validity dates. New taxation rules would become valid on the chosen date."/>
