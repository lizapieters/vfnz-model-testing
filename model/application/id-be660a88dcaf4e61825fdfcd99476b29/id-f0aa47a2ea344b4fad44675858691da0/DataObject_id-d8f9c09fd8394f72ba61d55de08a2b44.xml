    documentation="A CustomerAccount may be written off for two main reasons: Â Â Â Â Â  â€¢ When the dunning procedures failed to recover the debt; the bad debt must be written off and reported as such to the General Ledger Â Â Â Â Â  â€¢ When a contract terminates with a â€œminimalâ€� credit or debit balance (smaller than a threshold reflecting the cost of the collection process). The DunningWriteOff corresponds; in a dunning context; to a credit to definitively balance the CustomerAccount before being able to close it."/>
