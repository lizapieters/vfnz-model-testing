    documentation="This is an abstract base class that defines the different types of physical roles that a PhysicalDevice can take on. This enables us to correlate different logical roles to physical hardware. For example; the logical capability of encryption may need dedicated physical hardware. The PhysicalDeviceRole Encryption enables us to model this dependency."/>
