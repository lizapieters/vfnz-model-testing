    documentation="This association class represents the semantics of the AdjacentSlots association. It includes two attributes that are used to provide general layout information describing the Slots in the EquipmentHolder. The first; DistanceBetweenSlots; defines the distance in inches between two adjacent Slots in the PhysicalPackage. The second; SharedSlots; is a boolean attribute that describes the dependency between two Slots that are located in close proximity to each other. Sometimes; the two Slots are so close that if one of these Slots is populated by an adapter Card; the other Slot must be left empty. If this attribute is set to TRUE; then the second Slot must be left unoccupied.This association describes the layout of Slots in an EquipmentHolder. This association is implemented as an association class."/>
