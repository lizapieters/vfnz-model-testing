    documentation="The NetworkForwardingDomain (NFD) object class represents the capacity to enable forwarding and potential for forwarding via ForwardingReleationshipEncapsulation (FRE) constructs. The NFD represents the capability to define a route for forwarding across the contained network. The NFD represents capability for one or more specific layerProtocols where the relevant boundaries for each layerProtocol coincide appropriately It a grouping of zero or more: - TPEs which represent access to the NFD - subordinate NFDs which are a partition of its capacity (and hence completely contained) - TLs between the grouped subordinate NFDs The TPEs associated may terminate TopologicalLinks (TLs). NFD instances and TL instances together define the network topology. New TPEs may be assigned to the NFD and TPEs may be unassigned from the NFD. Note that the NFD object may be used to represent routing domains or other administrative domains. The domain groupings may be orthogonal. The top level NFD corresponds to the whole network for the layerProtocols it includes."/>
