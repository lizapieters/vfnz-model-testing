    documentation="This class represents the generic concept of a network address. Its subclasses define different types of addresses of different technologies; such as an IPAddress vs. an IPXAddress. Its utility lies in its ability to serve as a convenient point for sourcing and terminating relationships. This eliminates undue duplication of relationships that interact with the subclasses of NetworkAddress."/>
