    documentation="This is an abstract base class for representing hardware devices that can be managed. This class represents a convenient aggregation point for combining different aspects of a device (e.g.; the cables; connectors; cards; power supplies; and other objects that together make up the device). Thus; it enables the device itself to have a physical manifestation (e.g.; the Internet Gateway Router can be identified as a PhysicalDevice). Examples of this class include routers and switches; computers; and other end-devices that are managed."/>
