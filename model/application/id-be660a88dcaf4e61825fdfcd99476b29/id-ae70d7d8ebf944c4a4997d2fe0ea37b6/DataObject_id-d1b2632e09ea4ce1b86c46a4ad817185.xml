    documentation="This is an abstract base class that represents managed entities; such as power supplies; fans and cables; wihch are required for the proper operation of the Device but have a primary function that is different than the primary end-user function(s) of the Device. The difference between AuxiliaryComponents and other subclasses of Equipment are whether or not the physical object performs a function intrinsic to the main function of the Device. This is best understood by way of example. Consider a Router. Its main function is to route and forward packets. A PowerSupply is an AuxiliaryComponent; because even though it is needed for the proper operation of the Router; it does not directly help in routing and forwarding packets. A LineCard (that provides routing functionality) is a subclass of Equipment because its purpose is to route and forward packets. Similar examples exist for different types of equipment; where their criteria may be different. For example; instead of whether it routes or forwards packets; the criterion does it carry signal may be useful to appropriately classify components."/>
