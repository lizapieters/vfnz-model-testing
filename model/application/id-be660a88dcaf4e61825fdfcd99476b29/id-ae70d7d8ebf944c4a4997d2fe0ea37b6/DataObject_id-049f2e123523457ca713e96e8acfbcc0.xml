    documentation="This class represents an actual or potential end point of a topological (physical) link; and corresponds directly to a physical port on a topology map. PhysicalPorts are always contained by another physical object - they cant exist by themselves. The two most common examples are PhysicalPorts on a Card and on a Chassis."/>
