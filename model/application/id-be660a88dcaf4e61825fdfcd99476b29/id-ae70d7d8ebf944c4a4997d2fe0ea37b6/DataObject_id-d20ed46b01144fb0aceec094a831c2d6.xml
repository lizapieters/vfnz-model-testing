    documentation="This is the main entity of the diagram (figure) for number portability and a concrete base class formed with NumberPortInRequest; NumberPortOutRequest; NumberPortOverRequest and NumberRetirementRequest. It has the attributes: ID (inherited); name; description (inherited); version; status (inherited); source; ProgramDate and telephonyType. The attribute version exist to manage all kinds of different versions during the whole lifecycle of the portability. This is precisely for cases like; if a client has an instance of a new number portability; exist a following or a trace. This can be approach through versioning. This can happen easily because the portability is associated with rules; many policies can apply for a certain period of time and change over time too; and may not belong necessarily to the same version. The attribute Source is applied to PortOver and Retirement; because they donâ€™t have a direct relationship with other domains; they go straight directly through other sources. NPT needs a list of numbers to port over or to retire; and a source; that could be external or from any other origin. And last; Port In and Port Out need a program date (hence the attribute) to port; they both have a relationship with other domains; since they are issued by a customer order. The status attribute allows to see the availability of the request. It also considers the type of telephony for numbers for the portability; like mobile; fixed and IP numbers related to the request through the attribute TelephonyType."/>
