    documentation="This is a concrete class that represents any type of physical resource that can play a physical adapter role. The Adapter role enables a piece of Hardware to adapt its use. For example; sometimes Cards and Chassis evolve along separate paths; causing future versions of one to no longer be physically compatible with present and/or future versions of the other. The solution to this is to use an intermediate piece of Hardware; called an Adapter; to extend the existing physical structure of an EquipmentHolder to enable otherwise incompatible Equipment to be plugged into an EquipmentHolder. The Adapter conceptually creates a new type of EquipmentHolder that fits into the existing EquipmentHolder. This enables Cards that would otherwise be physically and/or electrically incompatible with the existing EquipmentHolder to be supported; by interfacing to the old EquipmentHolder via the new Adapter."/>
