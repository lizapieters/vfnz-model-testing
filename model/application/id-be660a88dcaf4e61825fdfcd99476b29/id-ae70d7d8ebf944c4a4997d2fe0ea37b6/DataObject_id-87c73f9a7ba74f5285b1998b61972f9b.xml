    documentation="This is an abstract base class for representing the different types of roles that various physical resources can take on. For this first iteration; two specialized roles have been defined: holder and adapter. This enables a single object; such as a Card; to have additional functions. For example; a Card may also serve as a motherboard or hosting board for another Card. In this situation; there isnt a separate EquipmentHolder - rather; the Card acts as a holder in addition to providing its normal functions. This class is the base class for defining different types of physical resource roles. Attributes are TBD."/>
