    documentation="This class gives a specific behavior and responsibilities to the requests; depending of many factors and the source provided. It has a portabilityStatus as a specific attribute and a generalization to an existing entity called LogicalResourceRole. This entity helps with the management and tracking of the status for the portability requests; since it can be initiated; started; completed; among others. This track is made for the requests through the continuous communications with other sources; like the entities Number Portability Clearinghouse and External System as party roles. Therefore; NumberPortability; because of its complexity; its management of different states between its flow with other sources; works with a NumberPortabilityRole through an aggregation. All the number portability requests have a behavior with an affinity and dependency to the different parties created and added. (NP Clearinghouse; External System; Customer). This relation affects directly to the tracking for the portability through a status. For this weve created the specific attribute portabilityStatus for the entity NumberPortabilityRole. Example: PartyRole ( Customer: NumberPortabilityRole ( portabilityStatus : created ) NumberPortabilityClearinghouse: NumberPortabilityRole ( portabilityStatus : accepted ) )"/>
