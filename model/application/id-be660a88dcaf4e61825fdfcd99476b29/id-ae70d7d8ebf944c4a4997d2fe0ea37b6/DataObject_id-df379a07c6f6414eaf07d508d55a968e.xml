    documentation="This is the base class for different types of PhysicalComponents that can reside either in an Equipment or an EquipmentHolder object. They can NOT be used as a stand-alone object. From a management point-of-view; this object either can not or does not need to be split into its constituent parts. For example; an ASIC (or Chip) can not ; and a tape for data storage does not; need to be split up into their constituent parts. Any piece of hardware that is not a PhysicalLink; PhysicalConnector; Equipment; or EquipmentHolder; is a subclass of this class."/>
