    documentation="This is an abstract class for representing atomic units of Software that are individually manageable and do NOT form composite; or nested; software units. From a finite state machine view; each AtomicInstalledSoftware element is not just individually manageable; but is also installable; executable; and runnable. In addition; each AtomicInstalledSoftware element can be a FRU. This is the super-class for creating concrete subclasses that define particular functionality (e.g.; a device driver; or software that implements MPLS as part of a larger routing software package)."/>
