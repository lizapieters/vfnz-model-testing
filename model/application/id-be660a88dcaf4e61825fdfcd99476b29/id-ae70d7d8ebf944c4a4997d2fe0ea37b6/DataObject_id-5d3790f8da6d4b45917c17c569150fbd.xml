    documentation="The CompoundResourceSpec used to define the invariant characteristics and behavior (attributes; methods; constraints; and relationships) of a CompoundResource. The key difference between a CompoundResourceSpec and either a PhysicalResourceSpec and a LogicalResourceSpec is that a PhysicalResourceSpec and LogicalResourceSpec define templates for specifying the invariant characteristics and behavior of PhysicalResources and LogicalResources; respectively. Optionally; one or more CompoundResourceSpecs may also be specified. Thus; a CompoundResourceSpec is in effect a shorthand notation for specifying complementary PhysicalResourceSpecs and / or LogicalResourceSpecs."/>
