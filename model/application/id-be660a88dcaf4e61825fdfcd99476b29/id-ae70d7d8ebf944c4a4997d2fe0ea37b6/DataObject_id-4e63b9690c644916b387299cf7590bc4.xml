    documentation="A ResourceFunction is described by a ResourceFunctionSpec specifying the possible configurations. A ResourceFunction is a function to transform inputs of any nature into outputs of any nature independently from the way it is provided. Each time a ResourceFunctionSpecification is provided whatever the way it is done (SoftwareSpecification; SoftBlackBoxSpec or PhysicalBlackBox); a ResourceFunction is created with its ConnectionPoints. The ResourceFunction is provided either by an InstalledSoftware; a SoftBlackBox; or a PhysicalBlackBox. These relationships are exclusive."/>
