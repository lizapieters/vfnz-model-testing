    documentation="A ResourceFunctionSpec specifies a function as a behaviour to transform inputs of any nature into outputs of any nature independently from the way it is provided. It is typically created by a function designer who may not have specific knowledge on realisation architecture (for example using English text explanations with diagrams; like RFC standards; or preferably a machine interpretable language). NetworkFunctionSpec; OfficeFunctionSpec as well as GameFunctionSpec are examples of specialisation. The realization/deployment of a ResourceFunctionSpec may be achieved by different ways; either SoftwareSpecification; PhysicalBlackBoxSpec or SoftBlackBoxSpecification. Examples: manually or automated by software or hardware implementing algorithms etcâ€¦ without any impact on the definition of the functions itself. A ConnectionPointSpec is used to describe the information/data input to a ResourceFunctionSpec or output from a ResourceFunctionSpec. This description is captured independently from the way it is realised."/>
