    documentation="Conceptually; a ServiceBundle is thought of as a collection of ResourceFacingServiceSpecifications. This enables the needs of different sets of ResourceFacingServiceSpecifications to be grouped together; hence; the name bundle. Since these are ResoureFacingSpecifications; they define reusable templates for implementing the ResourceFacingServices that are required by a particular CustomerFacingService (as represented by a ServicePackage). ServiceBundles were designed to define a set of Class of Service specifications that were required by a CustomerFacingService to work together. A ServicePackage is the entity that models the requirements of the CustomerFacingService. Thus; ServicePackages can specify different packaging of CustomerFacingServices that are obtained by a Customer via a Product; and ServiceBundles specify the set of ResourceFacingServices that each CustomerFacingService requires. ServiceBundles are a natural way to implement the requirements of a ServicePackage; and are related to a ServicePackage through the ServicePackageUsesServiceBundles aggregation."/>
