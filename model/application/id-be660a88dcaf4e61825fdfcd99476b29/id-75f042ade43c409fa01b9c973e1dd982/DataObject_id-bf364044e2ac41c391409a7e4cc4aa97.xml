    documentation="This class is the abstract base class for defining all types of VPNServiceSpecifications. It contains basic shared attributes; relationships and constraints for defining a VPNService without specifying the specific type and technology used (e.g.; IPsec vs. MPLS) to implement the VPNService. For example; this class will specify the SLS that governs its performance requirements; as well as other behavior that is independent of the VPN type. The subclasses of this VPNServiceSpecification will specify additional attributes; relationships; and constraints that are specific to the type of VPN being implemented."/>
