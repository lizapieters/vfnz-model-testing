    documentation="The ResourceFacingServiceSpec represents the technical solutions that the Service Provider can implement for CustomerFacingServiceSpec. Each technical solution (ResourceFacingServiceSpec) requires ResourceSpecifications to be realized and might require buying part of the solution to a supplier (for example the Service Provider might have to buy the Local Loop to provide a broadband access). This is the base entity for defining different types of ResourceFacingServiceSpecs. A ResourceFacingServiceSpec is an abstraction that defines the shared characteristics of a particular ResourceFacingService. The shared portion serves as a single common basis to build a set of variable ResourceFacingServices that all use this common ResourceFacingServiceSpec. This class can be thought of as a template; which represents a generic specification for implementing a particular type of Service. A ServiceSpecification may consist of other ServiceSpecifications supplied together as a collection. Members of the collection may be offered individually or collectively. ServiceSpecifications may also exist within groupings; such as within a Product. ServiceSpecification inherits from EntitySpecification; which inherits from RootEntity."/>
