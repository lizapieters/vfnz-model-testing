    documentation="ServiceSpecificationRole is an abstract base class that defines a ServiceSpecification in terms of a set of roles. The roles are then used to characterize the shared functionality of the Service; regardless of whether it is a resource or a customer facing service. ServiceSpecificationRoles represent the shared functionality of a ServiceRole. Representing a Service in terms of ServiceSpecificationRoles enables the functionality of the Service to be defined independently of BusinessActor; PhysicalResource; LogicalResource; or other Services."/>
