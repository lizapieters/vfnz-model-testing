    documentation="This is an abstract base class that defines an integrated set of CustomerFacingServices that collectively meets the needs of a Product. For example; the Customer may have requested GoldService; which is a ServicePackage that defines a set of ServiceBundles; each of which has its own QoS. This enables GoldService to be abstracted and treated as a managed object that provides a CustomerFacingService."/>
