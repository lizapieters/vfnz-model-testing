    documentation="This is the base entity for defining the Service hierarchy. All Services are characterized as either being related to Products or Resources. This gives rise to the two subclasses of Service: CustomerFacingService (used to realie a Product) and ResourceFacingService (which support the network/infrastructure facing part of the service). Services are defined as being tightly bound to Products. A Product defines the context of the Service; Service and its related entities (e.g.; ServiceSpecification; ServiceRole; and so forth) are related to entities in the Resource; Product; and other domains through a set of relationships. A Service represents the object that will be instantiated. Each Service instance can be different; therefore; Service is limited to owning just the attributes; relationships; and constraints that are specific to an instance of a Service. The shared attributes; relationships; and constraints that can be instantiated are defined by a ServiceSpecification. The purpose of this entity is twofold. First; it is used to define attributes; and relationships that are common to all Services. Second; it provides a convenient point to define how Services interact with other parts business entities."/>
