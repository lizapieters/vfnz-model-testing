    documentation="A ServiceBundleSpecAtomic object models different ServiceBundleSpecs as a set of different instances of individual; independent ResourceFacingServiceSpecs. This is fundamentally different than the ServiceBundleSpecComposite object; which is used to model one ServiceBundleSpec as the combination of other existing ServicePackageSpecs (as well as providing its own extensions). For example; assume that the GoldPackage service offering (which is a subclass of ServicePackage; not ServicePackageSpec); requires two different CoSService instances. This may be because the GoldPackage service offering has two different groups of applications that require two different types of traffic conditioning mechanisms. This is represented by a ServiceBundleSpecAtomic object. Now; assume that the PlatinumPackage service offering includes the GoldPackage service offering and a new service offering requiring a new set of traffic conditioining mechanisms. This requires a second ServiceBundleSpecAtomic object; as we want to reuse the first ServiceBundleSpecAtomic object. These could be aggregated together to form an instance of a ServiceBundleSpecComposite object."/>
