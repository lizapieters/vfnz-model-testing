    documentation="A ServicePackage is derived from an associated ServicePackageSpec. The ServicePackageSpec defines the shared attributes; relationships; and constraints for all ServicePackage instances that are derived from it. This enables each individual ServicePackage to add its own application-specific changeable characteristics and behavior. Note that there is no specific aggregation used to relate a particular ServicePackage to the ServicePackageSpec that it is derived from. This is because the ServicePackageSpec and ServicePackage both inherit the SpecifiesService aggregation; and at this (the business level) view; there are no new semantics that are required to represent this relationship. Finally; while the composite pattern could be applied to ServicePackage; there is no perceived need to do so. Multiple ServicePackages will simply be aggregated by a ProductBundle; and appear as separate ProductComponents."/>
