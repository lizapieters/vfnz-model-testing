    documentation="A standardized method for vulnerability measurement and severity scoring. Notes: Three scoring specifications have been created; one for each of the categories of system vulnerabilities defined by NIST SCAP. They include the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) which address software flaw vulnerabilies (introduced in 2004/v2 in 2007); the Common Misuse Scoring System (CMSS) which was designed for measuring and scoring misuse vulnerabilities. And the Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS) which addresses software security configuration issue vulnerabilities."/>
