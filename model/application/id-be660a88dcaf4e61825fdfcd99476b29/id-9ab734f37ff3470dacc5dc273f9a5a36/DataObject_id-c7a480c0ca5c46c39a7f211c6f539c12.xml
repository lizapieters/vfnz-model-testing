    documentation="This class implements the semantics of the DirectsEnforcementOf association. This association defines the set of PolicyEnforcementPoints that are managed by this PolicyDecisionPoint.This association defines the set of PolicyEnforcementPoints that a given PolicyDecisionPoint can direct. The semantics of this association are implemented using the PEPDirectionsDetails association class. The cardinality of this association is 1 on the PolicyDecisionPoint side and 1..n on the PolicyEnforcementPoint side. This means that a PolicyDecisionPoint can provide decisions for one or more PolicyEnforcementPoint (note that without a PolicyEnforcementPoint a PolicyDecisionPoint is useless). However; if multiple PolicyDecisionPoints are allowed to tell a given PolicyEnforcementPoint what to do; then there is no guarantee that the PolicyDecisionPoints wont conflict with each other. Thus; there can only be one PolicyDecisionPoint for a given PolicyEnforcementPoint."/>
