    documentation="This is an abstract class for defining two types of collection classes. PolicyRule collects PolicyEvents; PolicyConditions; and PolicyActions; while PolicyGroup collects PolicyRules and PolicyGroups. Two important and powerful features of this arrangement are that a PolicySet defines a common decision strategy and a common set of PolicyRoles to be used by the PolicyGroups and the PolicyRules that inherit from it."/>
