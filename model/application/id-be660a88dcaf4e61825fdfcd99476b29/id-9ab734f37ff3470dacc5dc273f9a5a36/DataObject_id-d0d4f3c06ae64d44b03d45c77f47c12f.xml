    documentation="This is a concrete base class that defines the concept of various types of roles used to describe PolicyBrokers and their use in the model. A PolicyBrokerRole refines the generic concepts of a PolicyApplicationRole. Specifically; this base class is used to describe generic functionality inherent in a PolicyBroker. For example; this includes the ability to present and negotiate functionality that is traded between different PolicyServers in different PolicyDomains; as well as the ability to control the functions of a PolicyServer."/>
