    documentation="This is a concrete base class that defines the concept of various types of roles used to describe processes that control configuration processes; and their use in the model. A PolicyConfigDecisionRole refines the generic concepts of a PolicyConfigRole. Specifically; this base class is used to describe different processes required to request decisions involving the monitoring; changing and/or verifying of the configuration of a Managed Object. These processes will orchestrate the use of one or more instances of other PolicyConfigRoles as part of executing the configuration decision."/>
