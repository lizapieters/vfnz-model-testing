    documentation="MetricDefMeasureExpression describes strict relations between MetricDefMeasure subordinates (MetricDefMeasureThresholdRule; MetricDefMeasureApplicability; MetricDefMeasureConsequence). The baseline idea of MetricDefMeasureExpression is to resolve the multiple associations between MetricDefMeasure subordinates. For example; an expression may consist of a consequence and its applicability for a MetricDefMeasure."/>
