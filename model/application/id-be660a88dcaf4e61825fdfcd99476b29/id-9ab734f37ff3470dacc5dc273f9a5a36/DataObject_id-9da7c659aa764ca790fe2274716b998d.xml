    documentation="This class implements the semantics of the DirectsExecutionOf association. This association defines the set of PolicyExecutionPoints that are managed by this PolicyDecisionPoint.This association defines the set of PolicyExecutionPoints that a given PolicyDecisionPoint can direct. The semantics of this association are implemented using the PXPDirectionDetails association class. The cardinality of this association is 1 on the PolicyDecisionPoint side and 1..n on the PolicyExecutionPoint side. This means that a PolicyDecisionPoint can provide decisions for one or more PolicyExecutionPoints (note that without a PolicyExecutionPoint; a PolicyDecisionPoint is useless). However; if multiple PolicyDecisionPoints are allowed to tell a given PolicyExecutionPoint what to do; then there is no guarantee that the PolicyDecisionPoints wont conflict with each other. Thus; there can only be one PolicyDecisionPoint for a given PolicyExecutionPoint."/>
