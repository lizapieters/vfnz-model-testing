    documentation="The PolicyActionComposite class is the base class for serving as a generic container in which to place PolicyActionAtomic; PolicyActionVendor; or PolicyActionComposite classes. The first two provide actions that this container groups; while the latter establishes a hierarchy in which to order the execution of PolicyActions. Both simple as well as complex PolicyActions can be placed in this container. Each PolicyActionAtomic and PolicyActionVendor object is linked to this object using the containedPolicyActions association."/>
