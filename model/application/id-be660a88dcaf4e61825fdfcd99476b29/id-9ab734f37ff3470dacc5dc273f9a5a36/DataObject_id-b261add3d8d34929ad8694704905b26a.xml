    documentation="The PolicyConditionComposite class is designed to be an intelligent container. The PolicyConditionComposite class is the base class for all complex policy conditions. A complex policy condition consists of an aggregation of PolicyConditionAtomic and/or PolicyConditionComposite objects; which in turn form a complex Boolean statement. It is important to note that such an object still evaluates to a single Boolean TRUE or FALSE value. Conceptually; this is a stand-alone object that consists of one PolicyCondition that provides an overall context for either a nested or a group of subordinate PolicyConditions to be evaluated."/>
