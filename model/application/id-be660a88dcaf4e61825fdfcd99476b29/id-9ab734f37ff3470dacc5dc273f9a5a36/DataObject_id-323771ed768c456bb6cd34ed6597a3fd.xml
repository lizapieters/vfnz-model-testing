    documentation="This is an abstract class that extends the RootEntity class in order to represent classes of objects that play a business function. Entities can be either managed or unmanaged. If it is managed; then it is further defined by a ManagedEntity; else it has no relationship with ManagedEntity. More formally; an Entity represents objects that have a separate and distinct existence. They are not just a collection of attributes or an abstraction of behavior."/>
