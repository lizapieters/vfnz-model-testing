    documentation="This is an abstract class for modeling different types of variables that can be used to form a PolicyStatement. The variable specifies an attribute or concept that should either be matched or in some way compared to a value when the condition is evaluated. There are three important factors that must be taken into account in the design of variables. The first is that not every combination of a variable and a value creates a meaningful condition. For example; port numbers cannot be negative. Rather; the type of variable in the condition defines the set of matchable value types. Second; just because a value has the correct datatype does not mean that it can be meaningfully compared to a variable. To continue the above example; a port of 1;000;000 is meaningless. This is handled in this model by specifying constraints (using OCL) that apply to a particular variable that must be obeyed by any value that it is being compared to. The ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association binds a PolicyVariable to a PolicyValue; any constraints that are required in this binding are added to an instance of this association using OCL. Third; while the SID model defines a set of useful PolicyVariables; there is a high likelihood that specific applications will need extensions to these variables. This is accommodated through the notion of implicit and explicit PolicyVariable classes."/>
