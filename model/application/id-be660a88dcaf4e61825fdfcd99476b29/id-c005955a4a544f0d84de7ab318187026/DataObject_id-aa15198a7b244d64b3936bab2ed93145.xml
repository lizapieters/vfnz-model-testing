    documentation="An occurrence (happening) or schedule that triggers the creation of a billing charge for a product offering. For example; a price event instance may represent the end of a month when monthly recurring billing charges are created. In some cases; the creation of a charge associated with a ProductOfferingPrice may be triggered by multiple events. For example; a penalty (ProductOfferingPrice) may be triggered by over- or under-usage of a service. Under- and over-usage are represented as two separate PriceEvent entity instances."/>
