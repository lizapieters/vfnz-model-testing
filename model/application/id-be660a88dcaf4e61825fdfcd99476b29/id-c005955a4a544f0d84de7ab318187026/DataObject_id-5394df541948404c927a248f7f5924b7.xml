    documentation="A detailed description of a tangible or intangible object made available externally in the form of a ProductOffering to Customers or other Parties playing a PartyRole. The ProductSpecification represents a product specification as perceived by the business user and specifies what the marketing operator wants to sell at a functional level (i.e. what are the capacities; which usages are availableâ€¦). It can represent: â€¢ material goods (Terminal; phone; mobile; fax; modem) â€¢ or intangible goods (like an Anti-Spam service for email). When the ProductSpecification represents a tangible goods; it is realized as ResourceSpecification. Corresponding Resources are stored in warehouses or bought to a supplier on demand. When the ProductSpecification is an intangible good; it is either realized as a CustomerFacingService (when the Service Provider is able to realize it) or bought as a ProductSpecification proposed by a Supplier (when the Service Provider is not able to realize it). For example; a Broadband know-how might be built or bought depending on the location of it. The ProductSpecification corresponds to a sub-set of the Service Providerâ€™s know-how according to what marketing people want to sell. Therefore; a ProductSpecification is a restriction of CustomerFacingServiceSpecs. A ProductSpecification may consist of other ProductSpecifications supplied together as a collection. Members of the collection may be offered in their own right. ProductSpecifications may also exist within groupings; such as ProductCategories; ProductLines; and ProductTypes. Note: Since SID 16.0; ProductSpecification is a sub-class of EntitySpecification. Therefore it inherits from RootEntitys attributes (ID; name; description). Thats why the previous attributes name; description and productNumber (corresponds to ID) have been removed from ProductSpecification. While the â€œdescriptionâ€� attribute inherited from RootEntity is optional (not required in a SID implementation); in the case of ProductSpecification it is required."/>
