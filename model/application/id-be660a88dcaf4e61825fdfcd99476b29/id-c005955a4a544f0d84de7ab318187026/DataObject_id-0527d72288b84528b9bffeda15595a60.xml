    documentation="A discount is a reduction in price. It could be a flat fee such as 10 dollars or a percentage; such as 50% off. A discount always applies to; and thus is associated with; one or more other ProdOfferPrices. So a discount would be 10 dollars off the installation fee or 50% off the per-minute rate."/>
