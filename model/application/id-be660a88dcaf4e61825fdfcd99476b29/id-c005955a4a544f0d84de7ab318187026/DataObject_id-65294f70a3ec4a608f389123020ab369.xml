    documentation="A ProductManager is a party role which is responsible for the development of products for an organization. Product managers own the business strategy behind a product; specify its functional requirements and generally manage the launch of corresponding ProductOfferings. They coordinate work done by many other functions (like software engineers; data scientists and product designers) and are ultimately responsible for the business success of the product."/>
