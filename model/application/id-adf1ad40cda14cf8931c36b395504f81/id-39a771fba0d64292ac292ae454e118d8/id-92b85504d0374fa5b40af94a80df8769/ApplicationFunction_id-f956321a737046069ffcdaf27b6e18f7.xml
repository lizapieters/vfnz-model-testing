    documentation="Application Programming Interface Gateway Routing function performes content-based routing, fail-over, load balancing, and broadcasting of requests. &#xA;The gateway can also validate to ensures that only valid messages (according to their contractï¿½s schema) are routed to the remote host (Inbound and Outbound flow control). This capability lowers dramatically the number of malformed messages that are presented to a given service enabler, and by doing so contributes to maximize the performance and scalability of that service enabler.">
