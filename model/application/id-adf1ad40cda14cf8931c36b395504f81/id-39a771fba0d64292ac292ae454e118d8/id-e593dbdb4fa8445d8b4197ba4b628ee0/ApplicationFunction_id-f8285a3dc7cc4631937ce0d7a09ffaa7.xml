    documentation="This function entails requesting that another inventory (referred to as the target OSS) update the inventory based on a provided collection of updates. The expectation is that the target inventory is updated as requested, but no other side-effects are expected (e.g., creating an Sub Network Connection (SNC) in the network). This is a key point concerning this capability. The inventory update request can involve addition (new object), modification (change to an existing object) or deletion (removal of an object).">
