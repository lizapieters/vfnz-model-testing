    documentation="Virtual network operators are typically service providers that do not own their own network but sell communications services under their own brand on top of another service provider�s network. Some VNOs also do not own their own Business Support Systems (BSS) and �lease� these systems from the network provider that provides their network services. Such VNOs are the focus of this section. The network provider that �leases� the business support systems to the VNO should therefore provide a separate online application for the VNO agents to be able to manage their customers, and handle fulfillment, assurance and billing issues for these customers.">
