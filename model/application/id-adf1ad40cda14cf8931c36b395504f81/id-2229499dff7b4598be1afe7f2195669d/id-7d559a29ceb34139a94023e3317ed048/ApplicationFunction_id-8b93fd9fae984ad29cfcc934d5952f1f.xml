    documentation="Wholesale billing applications include a variety of capabilities. Traditionally this area included inter-carrier settlements capabilities and this was later extended to interconnect billing applications. In todayï¿½s competitive markets and complex value chains, it has expanded further to include among others Roaming, wholesale operators, resellers, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, Content Providers and E-Commerce. There is now an array of applications in the area providing charging, billing, and settlement capabilities on a raw data basis, individual transaction basis and bulk basis across a variety of services and platforms. These applications work across a variety of platforms and support a wide range of services, preferably in one single system. Wholesale applications need to adhere to international standards such as TAP and RAP files, which are processed in Roaming solutions.">
