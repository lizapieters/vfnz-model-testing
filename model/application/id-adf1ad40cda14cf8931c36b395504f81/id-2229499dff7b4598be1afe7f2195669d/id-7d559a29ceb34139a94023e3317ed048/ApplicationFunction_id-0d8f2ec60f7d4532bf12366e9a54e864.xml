    documentation="Product Strategy is an action plan for meeting the objectives of an operating strategy via the products sold to the marketplace. Product Propositions are ideas on how the strategy will be realized through products sold within specific target markets. Product Strategy / Proposition Management is therefore the ability to capture and manage the detail of a company�s strategy and resulting propositions, that then drive what products they will develop, deliver and sell. This capability allows the management of this information at the enterprise level, across the different operating groups and market units within which the enterprise operates. Finally, it provides the ability to link the product propositions to the actual sellable products in order to track how the product strategy is actually be delivered into the marketplace.&#xA;The ability to hold this information enables downstream performance reporting to validate or negate a company�s product strategy and underlying propositions.">
