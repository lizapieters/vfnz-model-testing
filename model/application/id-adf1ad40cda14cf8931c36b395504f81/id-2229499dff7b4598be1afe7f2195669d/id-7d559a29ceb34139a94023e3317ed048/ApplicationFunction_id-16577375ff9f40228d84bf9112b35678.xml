    documentation="Resource Test Management applications are focused on ensuring that the various resources are working properly. The resource test applications are part of both the fulfillment and the assurance process. In the fulfillment process, the resource test is responsible for ensuring that the assigned service works as designed, while on the assurance side the resource testing applications are responsible for fault isolation. As part of the testing process, these applications also interface with the trouble process, which can trigger an automatic test.">
