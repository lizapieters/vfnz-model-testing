    documentation="The Resource Order Configuration Management function is similar to the service design/ assign functions outlined elsewhere in this publication. The service is built up of services and the services are built of resources. For a full compound Service configuration there is a need for Resource configuration for the Resource Order to support aggregate customer facing services. Services can be viewed as being comprised of a number of building blocks - e.g. bandwidth, security, maintenance packages, SLAs, QoS, specific features e.g. voicemail. Service Configuration management might be either the set up of network / resource components for a customer, or a class of customers of a generic service build. Service configuration can be derived from order details in addition to inherent business rules from service specifications.">
