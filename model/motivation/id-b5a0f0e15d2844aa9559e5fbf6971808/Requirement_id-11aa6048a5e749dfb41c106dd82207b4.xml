      value="Very much like insurance, but Customer pays a service fee. It is an additional option that can be added during device order (or in one months time) and later paid monthly. Once a customer desides to disable this option, he cannot add it again for the same device. There may be a few variants with different prices depending on the device price and level of insurance. Integration with 3rd party (digital portal) for claims. Different levels of integration possible. Light option is preferred (register claim and pass it to 3rd party). Integration details to be defined during AIF sessions."/>
