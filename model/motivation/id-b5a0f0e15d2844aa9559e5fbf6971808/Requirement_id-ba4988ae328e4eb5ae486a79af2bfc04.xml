      value="Is charging for single payment over pre-defined period (daily, weekly, fortnightly, 4 weekly, monthly, annually) still required? This was not mentioned during Micropurchases presentation. Sounds more like buying and add-on and not real time charging. This is allowing for the scenario where a chargeable action can either be an add on OR a micropurchase. So we will need to have the ability to charge a per min or an add on (that can have different durations such as daily, weekly, etc)"/>
