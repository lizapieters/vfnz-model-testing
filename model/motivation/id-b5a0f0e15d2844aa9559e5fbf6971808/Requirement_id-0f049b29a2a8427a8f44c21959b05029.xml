Yes, in this case the payment is done when the device is dispatched. More details to come from VF about all possible scenarios. Cycle of payments should start from first use for new customers, TBC for existing customers, possibly on dispatch of device. DX: Table to still be worked through. some sceanrios: if it’s a regular sale we can charge when ordering, if it’s pre sales we will hold the funds on card during order, and make the actual charge when device is dispatched. If existing customer, still tbc if its done on device dispatch or cycle aligned."/>
