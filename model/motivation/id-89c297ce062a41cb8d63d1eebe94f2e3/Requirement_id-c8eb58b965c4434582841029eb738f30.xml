      value="What data should be visible &quot;aged trial balances&quot;? We assume that data will be exported to GL and verification will be done in GL? How often data should be exported to GL? How the accounting is done for subscription, prepaid, post paid models? Do you have any dedicated segments? DX response: The aged trial balance is a report which shows the aging of accounts receivables. We don't currently have this level of detail in SAP GL. Not sure what you mean by how the accounting is done. Usually when customer is billed we will DR accounts receivable, CR revenue. Daily exports to GL plus Monthly export."/>
