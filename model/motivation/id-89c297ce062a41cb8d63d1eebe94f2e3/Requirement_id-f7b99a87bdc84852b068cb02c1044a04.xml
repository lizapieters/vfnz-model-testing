      value="OLD: After a customer buys a blank sim, he should be able to activate it without selecting any plan (via IVR or webpage) - then the subscription becomes a &quot;no plan&quot; subscription in which he is able to make free calls and answer calls. When in this state he is able to select a proper plan. The plan is to allow the customer in no plan state for max of 12 months. After that the SIM should be deactivated. Agreed during workshop: Blank SIM cannot be used by the customer, when he tries to make voice or data connection he will be redirected to IVR or website. &quot;No plan&quot; status will be available only after &quot;grace period&quot;."/>
