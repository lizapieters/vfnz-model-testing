      value="What in case some services are left in legacy? Only possible for services that are not related to each other. Will they be potentially targetted for next campaigns (for example in a few months time)? In such case the up to date customer data (incl products) should be loaded again to Comarch CCM so that previous one is overriden. Note: CCM would hold the same customer both as BSS customer and prospect customer. Which notification preferences whould be taken into account? DX notification preferences should be leading. Note: the idea is that once a day the prospect customers database in CCM will be updated."/>
